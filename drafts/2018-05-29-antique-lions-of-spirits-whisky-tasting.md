  The Antique Lions of Spirits whisky tasting at the Oak Barrel.
---

The Antique Lions of Spirits Butterfly series is an independant bottling
of rare single cask whiskies and the Oak Barrel are having a [tasting][1].
The retail price of these bottles is quite high (up to $1169.10 high) so
I've been quite looking forward to getting the opportunity to taste them.
It's a pretty safe bet that I won't get the chance to taste most of these
again!
