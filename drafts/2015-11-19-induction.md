Here are two principles of induction on the natural numbers
$\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, ...\}$ from a book I'm reading:

**The Principle of Induction I** Suppose that $A \subset {\mathbb N}$,
$1 \in A$, and that for every $m$, $m \in A$ implies $m + 1 \in
A$. Then $A = \mathbb{N}$.

**The Principle of Induction II** Suppose that $A \subset {\mathbb N}$,
$1 \in A$, and that for every $m$, $\{1, ..., m\} \subset A$ implies
$m + 1 \in A$. Then $A = \mathbb{N}$.
