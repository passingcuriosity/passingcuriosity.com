Welcome to my rather disorganised blog. Most of what you'll find here are notes
about books and articles I've read, problems I've solved, and events I've
attended. Prominent topics include [books][], [events][], [Haskell][],
[Drupal][], and short [howtos][].

[Haskell]: /tags/haskell/
[books]: /tags/books/
[events]: /tags/event/
[howto]: /tags/howto/
