Today's <a href="http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/%7Ejon/NotYASS.html">NotYASS</a> session is entitled <a href="http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/%7Ejon/NotYASS7.html">The Matrix as metaphysics</a>. According to the blurb, we'll be discussing the various bits and pieces of work about the matrix as reality, the likelihood of this being the matrix, how one ought to live given that this is probably a simulation, etc.<br /><br />Some of the papers on this topic (many can be found at <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">www.simulation-argument.com</a>) are quite interesting and many of them specific to <span style="font-style: italic">The Matrix</span> require surprisingly little prior knowledge.<br /><br />Sounds like it'll be fun.
