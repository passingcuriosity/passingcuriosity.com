I've just spoken to <a href="http://thatlogicblog.blogspot.com/">Jon</a> about the problems and ideas I have <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/07/thoughts-on-hypergraphs.html">posted</a> about previously. One of the things I came away with is the suggestion that I might be thinking about  relational algebras (perhaps an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_set">algebra over a set</a>) rather than hypergraphs. I'm not entirely sure that this is the case (the "hypergraph" Wikipedia article above seems to describe what I'm thinking of), but the "algebra over a set" article is certainly applicable as well).<br /><br />As a result, I've been able to dig up a <a href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/project+algebra">couple of things</a> that look like they might help me implement support for generic frames (i.e. those with an arbitrary number of <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>-relations for arbitrary values of <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> greater than 0).<br /><br />While I've seen <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/brianbec/articles/246392.aspx">A Relational Algebra Simulator in Haskell</a> before, it didn't occur to me that it might be applicable to my problem. <a href="http://www2-data.informatik.unibw-muenchen.de/relmics/tools/RATH/">RATH - Relation Algebra Tools in Haskell</a>, however is new to me and looks like it provides a complete library (rather than the example program of the first link).<br /><br />Whether I have enough time to catch up on my course-work, finish my system (as it stands), write a thesis <emph>and</emph> learn enough about this topic to extend the system using such a generalisation remains to be seen.<br /><br />Another possibly useful generalisation might be to extend the concept of "relation" from sets of tuples to mutisets (or bags) of tuples, thereby allowing relations in a frame to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph">mutigraphs</a> (i.e. graphs allowing multiple edges between a given pair of vertices). The <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/fgl/Data.Graph.Inductive.html">Data.Graph.Inductive</a> library supports labelled edges which suggests that it might also support multigraphs to some degree (if edges with non-identical labels are non-identical, then you can simulate an unlabelled multigraph by  labelled each edge with an index).<br /><br />I'd like to write a generic graph library with support for multigraphs and [uniform] hypergraphs, possibly by extending Data.Graph.Inductive, but this will probably wind up being pushed back until the Christmas break.
