title: Alternative Relations on Graphs

---

This project has, so far, focused on visualising graphs of only one relation
on clauses, namely the parent-child relation. Whilst the addition of
temporality adds an extra dimension to such a view, it would be interesting to
expand the number of relations.

Another point which might bear investigation is the degree of temporal
locality in the graphs growth. A graph with iterations (or whichever time
quanta is appropriate) as nodes and the relation between the nodes of one
quanta and another being an edge between them. The degree of the relation
might be reflected in the weight of the edge. This could be visualised with a
time quanta being positioned in a ring layout, with the temporal relation
forming the ring, and the "share-a-relation" relation being the internal
links.
