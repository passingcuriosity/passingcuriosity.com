### The Questions

**Why has the lightbox on the web-site stopped working?**

**Why have the Y generation (or maybe a bit newer) not moved from IM to twitter?** Twitter is still in the alpha geek stage, and we alpha geeks tend to live in a bit of a coocoon. Not everyone in the world spends 24/7 online learning about new tech (and tweeting).

**When Twitter goes mainstream, do we all leave?** Yes. Remember ICQ? Take-up,
by geeks, tail, etc. (From the audience: "My Mum has a lower ICQ number than me.")

**CSS drop-down, works in Firefox, but not IE. Why?** `:hover` on non-a.

**GPL making software sales redundant?** The people who use OSS are alpha geeks. Being able to buy it, buy support, etc. It's not a silver bullet or a panacea by any stretch of the imagination.

**Do you think that distributed version control is going to kill centralised?** No. Decentralisation bad (in most people's circumstances).

**Is IE going to keep it's huge market share?** Probably. Inertia, status quo, don't care, etc.

**Do you have a favourite Australian tech podcast?** I don't listen to podcasts. I want to get the information and leave.

**Am I lazy using prototype for my AJAX?** No. Absolutely not. So long as you understand what it's doing, using frameworks is great.

**I just got here and I've got no idea what Edge of the Web is** The AWIA web conference announced today?

**What do you think about developing from a platform, rather than from first principals?** They're different. Different audiences (S3 is a remote platform, App Engine is a cloud, OpenSocial has a specific purpose).

**Lets say a client comes to you and asks you to build something; how do you estimate how long/much it'll take?** This is a problem that's been haunting the software community basically forever. It basically boils down to experience. Breaking it down into components helps estimate effectively and gives slack, etc.
