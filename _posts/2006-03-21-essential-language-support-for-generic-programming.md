<a class="title" href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/publications/prints/2005/siek05:_fg_pldi.pdf">Essential Language Support for Generic Programming</a> by Jeremy Siek and Andrew Lumsdaine.<br /><br />This paper presents an extension of <acronym>System F</acronym> called <acronym>System F<sup>G</sup></acronym>. The motivation for the work is in the construction of generic algorithms and, more importantly, the verification of their use. It looks to me as though the authors have taken a little bit too much of <acronym>C++</acronym> on board.<br /><br />The concepts of the paper are very similar to Haskell's type classes (according to section two, the main difference is that type classes are designed to allow Hindley-Milner type inference) and the associated types seem to me to be filling a similar role as functional dependancies. I found it rather interesting and it's the first type system paper I've read since I achieved a vague understanding of type systems.<br /><br /><a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1065010.1065021">ACM</a> | <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&cluster=5897839161837951891">Google</a>  | <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/b9489652d5c7013258e347d55cb2b69e">Del.icio.us</a> | <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/article/471759">CiteULike</a> | <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1366">LtU</a>
