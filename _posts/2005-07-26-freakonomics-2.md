I'm about half-way through reading <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> and, while it hasn't changed my opinion of economics, it has impressed upon me the flexibility of modern statistics. If you're dubious about the status of economics as a science in its own right, I don't think that this book will convince you one way or the other (it hasn't changed my opinion), but it is a fascinating, well written book.
