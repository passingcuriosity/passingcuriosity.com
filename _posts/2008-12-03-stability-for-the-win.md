The company that I use to host this site had a rather large problem yesterday -- routine maintenance of some power supply equipment by the service company went wrong when they blew the fuses on the UPS', couldn't get replacements, and ran out of diesel for the generator. Everything go boom. It took a while but everything is back up now and none of the sites I or my employer host with them appear to have lost anything but uptime.

Hopefully it won't happen again.
