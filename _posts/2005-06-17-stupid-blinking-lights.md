I have never liked strobing lights. From flashing on the TV screen, to lights at clubs, flashing lights make me uncomfortable. I doubt that it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_epilepsy">photosensitive epilepsy</a>.<br /><br />Lately, I've been irritated by the banner adds for the US Green Card Lottery (or whatever it is called). For some reason, someone has decided that a large blinking red/yellow block would be the best way to advertise the Green Card Lottery (which, in my opinion, has to be the single stupidest way to manage an immigration system). <br /><br />I'm not sure if it has effected any photosensitive epileptics, but it sure as hell shits me off something chronic!
