The mid-semester holiday starts, for me, when I submit my second report for <span style="font-style: italic;">Milestone Papers in Computing</span>, that is, tomorrow morning. Rather than spend the next few weeks in cold, wet Canberra, I'm going to wet, cold Tasmania.<br /><br />While I'm there, my Internet access will be rather limited and I hope, in-spite (or perhaps because of) this, to get <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/goals-motivation-of-procrastination.html">a lot of work</a> done on my honours project.
