Today's Word of the Day is: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=unbosom">unbosom</a>.
<br />
<br />Some words derived from archaic or specialised usage, like disrobe perhaps, have evolved to have a more general meaning. Unbosom, though sounds contrived, a little bit naughty and, to me at least, gives not the slightest hint of its meaning: to confide (one's thoughts or secrets).
