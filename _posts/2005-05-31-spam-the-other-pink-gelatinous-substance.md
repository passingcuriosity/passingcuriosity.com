I just received a spam (regarding lifestyle medication) with the following as its filter-avoidance random text...<br /><blockquote>I like the word 'indolence.' it makes my laziness seem classy.<br />Gossip is sometimes referred to as halitosis of the mind<br />What's another word for Thesaurus?<br />Money is good for bribing yourself through the inconveniences of life.</blockquote>Perhaps spam is turning over a new leaf and attempting to contribute something back to the Internet, even if it is a few bad jokes that only a person such as myself would find amusing.
