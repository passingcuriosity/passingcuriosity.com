<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html">A4 paper format / International standard paper sizes</a> by Markus Kuhn.

I just checked a PDF to see if I'd be able to print it and needed to find which paper size is 216 mm wide by 279 mm tall. A quick <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> returned the page linked above. It includes an explanation of the ISO paper size standard, points out the regularity of the ISO sizes, their relation to other ISO units and the utility of such regularities.

It also explains just how brain-damaged the North American formats really are. I hadn't realised that North Americans can't enlarge documents properly as their paper sizes have several height to width ratios. I also didn't realise just how wide spread the ISO paper sizes are. According to Kuhn, the United States of America, Canada and Mexico are the only industrialised nations which don't use the ISO sizes widely.

I just wish that all the papers, books and theses that they produce came as A4 formatted PDFs.
