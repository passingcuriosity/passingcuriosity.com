<a href="http://chickenfeed.com.au/">Chickenfeed</a> have been flogging some cheep DVDs lately and every time I'm in one of their shops, I have a look at what they have in stock. The last time I did so, I got a copy of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0091445/">Lucas</a> &mdash; Winona Ryders' first feature film. I just got around to watching it tonight and, while it's <emph>really</emph> cliched in places, it does have a few redeeming features.<br /><br />The fairly drawn-out love-triangle (or, square, or even pentagon, depending on how you count) could have been resolved a lot quicker. It would have been nice to see a resolution to the Rina-Lucas sub-plot, though doing so would have interfered with that time honoured '80s feel-good film tradition: the closing freeze frame of the hero triumphant. My view can quite easily be summed up as: O.K., but more Winona Ryder would have been nice (as though it needs to be said).
