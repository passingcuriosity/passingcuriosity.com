<p>I read this comment on a story a few days ago and was appalled.</p><blockquote>i am a 15 year old australian i think i am what americans would call a jok id prifer to run laps around a football or soccer field then reed eny thing i havent read eny thing in years but i started reeding this story at 11 at night and finished at 7in the morning i reeded 233 pages (i red some the night bifor) with out stoping and i reely injoyed it i reely want to know how it ends</blockquote><p>I'm not sure which is worse, the abysmal spelling and grammar, or the idea that the writer hadn't "read eny thing in years." If I hadn't encountered students with such poor literacy before, I'd think that it was a joke.</p><span class="tags"><strong>Tags:</strong><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/literacy">Literacy</a><!--<br />--> <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/thsutton/education">Education</a><!--<br />--></span>
