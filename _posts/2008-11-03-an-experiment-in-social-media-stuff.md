I'm a member of the [Perth Atheists meet-up](http://www.perthatheists.org/) and we had our monthly get together at the [Flying Scotsman](http://flyingscotsman.com.au/) in Mount Lawley tonight. Instead of the usual short talk (which are always entertaining, informative, excellent and awesome) this week was for "housekeeping" -- namely talking about what sort of group we want to be. The "housekeeping" label might have had something to do with the slightly reduced numbers, but the discussion was good nonetheless, with some excellent views and ideas of who and what and how our little group can grow and be and do *something*.

One avenue that was reasonably obvious to all (it is, after all, a meeting organised through a web-site) is an online presence to call our own: a web-site with some form of "easy-to-use" CMS or blogging platform installed and integrated with the various social media widgets that all the cool kids are using these days. Given that I work as a web-developer, I've put my hand up to help make a go of it.

There's already a domain name [perthatheists.org](http://www.perthatheists.org/) and hosting and people enough who can generate at least a little content, so we'll probably start simple with a blog (probably WordPress), a bit of social network integration -- post to *X*, link on *Y*, a Twitter bot, etc. -- and an e-mail list. In the next month or two we'll probably launch a small campaign or two like [Read Your God Damn Bible](http://www.readyourgoddamnbible.com/) and the [Gideon Removal Project](http://gideonremoval.godlessheathens.org.uk/).

In the mean time, a few of us will get to work preparing some content, developing a web-site, socialising the media, and hooking it all up to the intertubes. This time next month, we'll have us a web-site.
