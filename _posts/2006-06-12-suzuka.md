I've been watching [fansubs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansubs ) of the anime series [Suzuka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuka_%28manga%29 ) lately. *Suzuka* is about a boy (Yamato Akitsuki), a girl (Suzuka Asahina), their friends and the track and field team of an athletics oriented high school in Tokyo. It's been a while, but Suzuka reminds me a little of [Kimi ga Nozomu Eien](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2570 ) (another sport-related dramatic romance).

Hopefully, I'll get around to downloading and watching the rest of the series (I've watched 12 of 26) soon.

You can find more information about Suzuka at [Animesuki](http://www.animesuki.com/series.php/646.html ) or [A.N.N.](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5113).
