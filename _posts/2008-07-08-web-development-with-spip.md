[SPIP](http://www.spip.net/) is an open-source content management system based on PHP and MySQL. It has excellent support for multi-lingual sites, for community generated content, obtains exceptional search engine results with little effort, and has a very good administrative interface. Excellent though it is, it can be difficult to get started developing web-sites using SPIP due to its sometimes patchy English documentation. Thankfully the SPIP community is helpful and very friendly and I work with a Francophone who doesn't mind reading code and documentation to me.

The posts in the SPIP category contain various techniques I've gradually built up using SPIP full-time for the last six moths.
