A fourth post for today, also on a non-logic related topic. I'll be releasing an initial, non-modal, version of my code soon (in the next couple of weeks) and need to think about a licence for it. I've narrowed it down to four alternatives:<ul><li>the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.1/au/">attribution share alike</a> licence;</li> <li>the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.1/au/">attribution non-commercial share alike</a> licence; </li><li>the <a href="http://nicta.com.au/director/commercialisation/open_source_licence.cfm">Australian Public Licence B</a>; or</li><li>a BSD-like licence.</li></ul>I'm leaning toward the Creative Commons licences at this point, but the Australian Public License could be good as well.<br /><br />If anyone has suggestions or arguments for or against any licence (please don't bother suggesting the GPL and friends), please leave a comment.
