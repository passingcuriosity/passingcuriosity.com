I've just had a talk with <a href="http://www.rsise.anu.edu.au/~abate/">Pietro</a> about my project and directions in which I might move it. Pietro's PhD project (the <a href="http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~abate/twb/twb.html">Tableaux Work Bench</a>) is written in <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a> (an eager functional programming language) and works with <span style="font-style: italic;">implicit tableaux</span>. My Honours project (which needs a name, suggestions are welcome) is written in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> (a lazy, pure functional language) and works with <span style="font-style: italic;">labelled tableaux</span>.<br /><br />In spite of these differences, the projects are quite similar and Pietro's advice and suggestions are going to be invaluable. In our meeting, we discussed the data structures I am planning on using which has helped solidify my thoughts, which I shall write up and post this evening.
