![Megatokyo Volume 4 Cover](/files/2006/08/11/megatokyo-four-cover.jpg)

My copy of [Megatokyo](http://megatokyo.com/) volume 4 finally came in
and I bought it yesterday. It's good to see another Megatokyo book out
and it's fantastic that it took so long to come in (having sold out,
etc.).

The presentation is essentially the same as the first three volumes by
[Dark Horse](http://www.darkhorse.com/). The only shortcoming I can
see in the book is the binding -- for some reason
[CMX](http://www.cmxmanga.com) couldn't manage to glue the pages
level. It's no worse than the last book from Dark Horse and it *is* a
fairly minor flaw, but it would have been nice if they'd put that
little bit extra into the book's construction.
