I bought Madman Entertainment's <a href="http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?releaseId=4819&method=view">special edition</a> DVD of <a href="http://appleseedthemovie.com/">Appleseed</a> today and I've just finished watching it. The art is absolutely beautiful &mdash; equalling, if not surpassing, <span class="title">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</span> which is the current top of my ooooh-pretty-shiny-art list. <br /><br />One thing that struck me while watching it is that while the mecha and environments were absolutely gorgeous, the characters had a rotoscoped look to them (especially the shadows and hair) which seemed a little strange at first but definitely grew on me.<br /><br />Another thing that noticed (though it took until I watched the trailers afterwards) was that the scene where Deunan leapt from the top of a building to mount her <acronym title="The large mechanical suites worn by ES.W.A.T. soldiers in combat against armour and heavy weapons.">Landmate</acronym> bears quite a strong resemblance to the scene in Ghost in the Shell when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Kusanagi">Major Kusanagi</a> leaps off the top of a tower wearing optical camouflage. I'm not sure if it was homage to <acronym title="Ghost in the Shell">GitS</acronym>, a coincidence, or Masamune Shirow likes that shot enough to have it used in this film too; but I'd prefer to think it the homage.<br /><br />In short, this is yet another kick-ass film based on Masamune Shirow's work. If you liked the art in <acronym title="Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex">GitS:SAC</acronym>, the philosophy of <acronym title="Ghost in the Shell">GitS</acronym> and <acronym title="Man/Machine Interface">MMI</acronym>, the watch-ability of <span class="title">Dominion Tank Police</span> and want it mixed with more mecha action than you can shake a stick at, you'll love <span class="title">Appleseed</span>.
