<a href="http://mac.sofotex.com/download-125128.html">GNUPlot</a> (needs <a href="http://aquaterm.sf.net/">AquaTerm</a>)<br /><a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html">O'Caml</a><br /><a href="http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/">Graphviz</a><br /><br />I've been playing with some Open Source software for OS X lately. There are links above, and brief descriptions follow.<br /><br /><hr/><br />GNUPlot is everybodies favourite graph plotting software. At the link above, you can download a version compiled for OS X against AquaTerm, a package that allows gnuplot to draw to a native window under Aqua.<br /><br />O'Caml, is an object-oriented functional programming language in the ML family. I'll be working with it this year. From the official download page (linked above) you can get source distributions, or pre-compiled binary packages for many platforms, including OS X.<br /><br />Graphviz is a package for drawing diagrams of graphs and networks. The link above, is for an excellent OS X port of graphviz with a document-based GUI and support for lots of output format. It won a couple of awards and the OS X port, and Grapviz itself, is open source.<br /><br /><hr/><br />I'll post links to some more useful OS X software later on.
