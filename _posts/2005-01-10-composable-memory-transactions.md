I found this paper through a [link from Lambda the Ultimate][2], a weblog
about programming languages.

Though I've not yet read the complete paper, it has really impressed me. This
use of monads, for me at least, justifies them in a way and to an extent that
none of the rather limited set of explanations I've seen to date has been able
to. The simplicity with which the transactional framework described in the
paper can be used is amazing. Though I've yet to understand everything it
describes (especially the semantics and implementation which sections I
haven't even read yet), I think I'm going to have to get the GHC head, and
return to learning Haskell.

I think I'm going to have to go through the MS Research publications site for
more interesting things to read.
