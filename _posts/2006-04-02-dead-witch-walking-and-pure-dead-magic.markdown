<a class="title" href="http://kimharrison.net/Dead%20Witch%20Walking.htm">Dead Witch Walking</a> by <a href="http://www.kimharrison.net/">Kim Harrison</a>.<br /><br />Dead Witch Walking is yet another paranormal romance. In a similar vein to the works of Laurell K. Hamilton, Tanya Huff, Charlaine Harris, Kelly Armstrong, Sherrilyn Kenyon and many others, this blends aspects of the thriller; the fantasy; the crime and the romance novel into one compelling whole. <br /><br /><a href="http://isbn.nu/0060572965">Buy</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060572965">Amazon</a><hr/><br /><a class="title" href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/BookCatalog/ProductItem.asp?sku=1121827">Pure Dead Magic</a> by Debi Gliori.<br /><br />The first in a trilogy of children's books with magic and the supernatural as a main theme, <span class="title">Pure Dead Magic</span> is 220 pages long. Being a children's book, the writing, plot and characters are a little simple, but it was entertaining none the less. The Strega-Borgia family has about it an aura of the Addams Family, though Titus and Pandora (the 12 and 10 year old, respectively, hero and heroine) aren't as idiosyncratic as Pugsley and Wednesday Addams.<br /><br />A good book, from a good author, it'll appeal to most kids of an age to find <a href="http://www.emilyrodda.com/">Emily Rodda's</a> <span class="title">Deltora Quest</span> and <span class="title">Rowan of Rin</span> books interesting.<br /><br /><a href="http://isbn.nu/0552547573">Buy</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0552547573/">Amazon</a>
