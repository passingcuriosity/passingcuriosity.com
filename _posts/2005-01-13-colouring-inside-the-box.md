Now that the data sets can be reprocessed more easily, and have more,
relevant, data in them, I've started working on the colouring code. At the
moment, I've just cleaned up the colours (to get rid of the grey fill colour,
etc) and added highlighting of factors. In the image linked above, factors
appear as blue points, the green points on the left-hand side are the "given"
clauses and the black points are any edges not created by factorisation.

Also evident in this image are the diagonal lines mentioned in a [previous
post](/2005/the-end-is-nigh-or-at-least-in-sight/), caused by the
implementation of the theorem prover.

All in all, it has been a fairly productive day (so far).
