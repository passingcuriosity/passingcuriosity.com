  It's been more than two years since my last post about
  reading. Here's a summary of some of the fiction I've been reading
  recently.

My recent fiction reading has been a mix of new releases from authors
and series I already know and the odd discovery from Amazon's terrible
recommendation engine.

Tanya Huff's *Peacekeeper* series continues the story of Torin Kerr and
her associates. The war over and retired from the marines, they're now
working for the Justice Department to address the new sorts of law
enforcement problems: Humans First extremists, hostage takers, gun
runners, etc. The first two books are
[An Ancient Peace](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016AJS2BI) and
[A Peace Divided](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0711DNWLM).

Mike Shepard's Kris Longknife series is a long one:
[Kris Longknife - Admiral](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075DFYGBL) and
[Kris Longknife - Emissary](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2B8PC3) are
something like the 15th and 16th books that focus on Kris herself.
Contrary to the adage, you're pretty safe judging these books by their
covers: an easier reading, more popcorn-y Honor Harrington with
dirt-side gun fights instead of capital ship engagements.

Elizabeth Moon's new *Vatta's Peace* series follows on from *Vatta's
War* with two volumes released so far:
[Cold Welcome](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B010PIFTYS) and
[Into the Fire](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B010PIFZ5Q). I got sick of
waiting for the mass market release and bought the trade paperbacks of
these two and they are next in my reading queue.

Caitlin R. Kiernan's
[Agents of Dreamland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JZ6SIVC) and the
newly released [Black Helicopters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791JK87N)
feature the operatives of several agencies dealing with Kafka-esque
bureaucratic disfunction and horrors from beyond. Think the X-Files
versus Cthulhu, and something like the Atrocity Archives played
straight.

Margaret Killjoy's [The Lamb Will Slaughter the
Lion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5EVUQF) and [The Barrow Will Send
What it May](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756KSZV1) series follows
travelling anarchist Danielle Cain and a few companions in some sort
of anarchist Scooby Doo contemporary fantasy horror where the cops are
at least as much a threat as the monsters.

Kylie Chan's [Scales of Empire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XFP7DH2)
is something of an odd one. Human settlement of other systems is just
getting underway - news of the first few generation ships to reach
their destinations is just getting back to Earth - when contact is
made with a space-going dragons and the galaxy spanning empire they
rule. I'd call it more fantasy in space and sci-fi.
