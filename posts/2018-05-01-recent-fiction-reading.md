excerpt:
  It's been more than two years since my last post about reading. Here's
  a summary of some of the fiction I've been reading recently.

My recent fiction reading has been a mix of new releases from authors
and series I already know and the odd discovery from Amazon's terrible
recommendation engine.

[![An Ancient Peace][1p]][1]
[![A Peace Divided][2p]][2]

Tanya Huff's *Peacekeeper* series continues the story of Torin Kerr and
her associates. The war over and retired from the marines, they're now
working for the Justice Department to address the new sorts of law
enforcement problems: Humans First extremists, hostage takers, gun
runners, etc. The first two books are [An Ancient Peace][1] and [A Peace
Divided][2].

[![Cold Welcome][3p]][3]
[![Into the Fire][4p]][4]

Elizabeth Moon's new *Vatta's Peace* series follows on from *Vatta's
War* with two volumes released so far: [Cold Welcome][3] and [Into the
Fire][4]. I got sick of waiting for the mass market release and bought
the trade paperbacks of these two and they are next in my reading queue.

[![Kris Longknife - Admiral][5p]][5]
[![Kris Longknife - Emissary][6p]][6]

Mike Shepard's Kris Longknife series is a long one: [Kris Longknife -
Admiral][5] and [Kris Longknife - Emissary][6] are something like the
15th and 16th books that focus on Kris herself. Contrary to the adage,
you're pretty safe judging these books by their covers: an easier
reading, more popcorn-y Honor Harrington with dirt-side gun fights
instead of capital ship engagements.

[![Agents of Dreamland][7p]][7]
[![Black Helicopters][8p]][8]

Caitlin R. Kiernan's [Agents of Dreamland][7] and the newly released
[Black Helicopters][8] feature the operatives of several agencies
dealing with Kafkaesque bureaucratic dysfunction and horrors from
beyond. Think the X-Files versus Cthulhu, and something like the
Atrocity Archives played straight.

[![The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion][9p]][9]
[![The Barrow Will Send What it May][10p]][10]

Margaret Killjoy's [The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion][9] and [The Barrow
Will Send What it May][10] series follows travelling anarchist Danielle
Cain and a few companions in some sort of anarchist Scooby Doo
contemporary fantasy horror where the cops are at least as much a threat
as the monsters.

[![Scales of Empire][11p]][11]\ 

Kylie Chan's [Scales of Empire][11] is something of an odd one. Human
settlement of other systems is just getting underway - news of the first
few generation ships to reach their destinations is just getting back to
Earth - when contact is made with a space-going dragons and the galaxy
spanning empire they rule. I'd call it more fantasy in space and sci-fi.

[![Binti][12p]][12]
[![Binti: Home][13p]][13]
[![Binti: The Night Masquerade][14p]][14]
[![Kabu Kabu][15p]][15]

I really enjoyed Nnedi Okorafor's [Binti][12] and [Binti: Home][13] and
have [Binti: The Night Masquerade][14] waiting for me in my to-read
pile. [Kabu Kabu][15] is a collection short stories from a different,
but still super great, vein.

[![The Edge][16p]][16]
[![Comeback][17p]][17]

Dick Francis was a jockey and then went on to write mystery novels which
(as far as I know) all involved horses in some way. I recently re-read
[The Edge][16] and [Comeback][17] after first reading them on paper when
my uncle left them behind on a vist in the 90s.

[![Annabel Scheme][18p]][18]
[![Sourdough][19p]][19]

In 2009 I supported Robin Sloan's [Kickstarter project][20] to write and
publish a book (I'd called it a novella). It was the only successful
Kickstarter project I ever backed and produced [Annabel Scheme][18] (I
still have a few copies somewhere). [Sourdough][19] is more recent and I
bought and read it on my Kindle well after publishing. Both are great,
but I enjoyed *Sourdough* quite a bit more.

[![The Nakano Thrift Shop][21p]][21]\ 

Hiromi Kawakami's [The Nakano Thrift Shop][21] (translated by Allison
Markin Powell) is a slice of life novel with no particularly fascinating
characters and no exciting or momentous events. Still a good read.

There was quite a lot more, but this is probably the cream of the crop.
