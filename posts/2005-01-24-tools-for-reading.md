Since I got my iBook, I've been using [Bibdesk][1] to manage a BibTeX database
of the papers I've downloaded (and bothered transferring to my laptop). It's
quite cool. Well, once you get past a few bugs, it's quite cool. It ties in
with Preview's recent documents or will move a file that you select to your
"papers folder" (it won't do both as far as I can tell).

Whilst this is pretty cool, I've been thinking that BibTeX is a little
annoying (what with it wanting to rewrite capital letters unless you use
braces as the string delimiters, etc). Lately I've been thinking that perhaps
an XML format might be just what the doctor ordered. DC probably supports as
many fields as necessary. The only problem might be the bunch of publication
types that bibliography styles typeset differently, though I'm sure that there
is a DC element (and maybe a dictionary of terms) to describe document types.

In any case, I'm too lazy to switch from something that works (BibTeX, et al)
to something that I'd have to write myself (because using someone else's would
defeat the purpose :-).

Other things that might be useful are some software to convert PDF and PS
documents to text and an automatic text condenser and an outline editor. The
former would help process those pesky documents without abstracts, whilst the
latter would help note-taking and the like. If anyone happens to read this and
knows of any free software (for Mac OS X, or UNIX) which fits the descriptions
here, post links in a comment.
