I've just read/skimmed [Crest of the Stars][1] and [Banner of Stars I][2] and
started [Banner of Stars II][3] and I have to say, I'm not all that impressed
with the production quality. I love the art, especially in the first two books,
but the editing is not too impressive (with text placed awkwardly in the
"bubbles") and the glossaries of *Abh* words seem to have been quite rushed as
they are missing some terms that appear in the text (Though I haven't looked in
the other books yet for terms I've encountered in one) and one of the
definitions has been run into the previous, without the appropriate **bolding**
and *italicisation*.

In short, I get the impression that these particular books didn't have very
stringent proof-reading, etc before they went to press. Perhaps they were
rushed out due to the US release of the anime?  If anyone knows what happened
(my previous Tokyopop books have been pretty good), I'd be interested to
know.
