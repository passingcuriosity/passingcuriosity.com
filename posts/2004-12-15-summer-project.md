I remembered today that I had a Blogger account and thought that I should
probably use it for something. What better purpose than to document my summer
research project at the [Research School of Information Sciences and
Engineering][2] of the [Australian National University][3]. This blog then
will focus on my attempts to find a visual metaphor to help [humans]
understand the search an automated reasoning system performs whilst attempting
to prove a theorem.

Essentially this boils down to displaying very large graphs and the way they
change over time. Some examples of preliminary work [could] be found at my
project web page.
