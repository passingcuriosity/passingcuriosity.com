The [Sydney Python meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sydneypython/) for May was
this evening; here are some notes on the proceedings.

David Lyon gave an introduction to **Python on the Raspberry Pi**. He
mentioned [wiringpi2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wiringpi2) for general
purpose I/O in the same vein as Wiring. I thought he spent gave too much
credence to the suitability of general purpose uses of the Raspberry Pi when
it's the ability to hook it up to hardware that's truly interesting.

**Announcements**: some startup wants a new co-founder; a new site based on
Zope has launched: [swimmingpoolregister.nsw.gov.au][spr].

[Eugene Van den Bulke](http://www.3kwa.com) gave a talk about **using the
[pandas](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas) library** for statistical
analysis and, in the process, demonstrated the awesomeness of iPython Notebook
(see the notebook at [goo.gl/c84WQ](http://goo.gl/c84WQ)). Particularly
interesting were the I/O libraries for dealing with data in Google Analytics.
Alas, he also used "data scientist" without scare quotes.

Someone else, whose name I missed, gave a brief **introduction to R** as a
lightening talk so that we'd all have a basis for comparison. He used
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) which looked pretty interesting. He also
described [RPy2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpy2), a Python library which
provides an interface to R. After the break someone else (was it Jiří Baum?)
mentioned [gnumpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gnumpy), which is like Numpy
but ships stuff to the GPU for processing.

Tim Ansell spoke about **playing with gstreamer pipelines in Python**. He gave
a quick rundown on gstreamer pipelines, the `gst-launch` command and the `gst`
Python module. I've been meaning to play with [gstreamer][] since an LCA talk
a few years ago; perhaps it's time?
