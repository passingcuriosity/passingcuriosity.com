title: Categories and Tags

I've added support for [tags][1] to this blog using Del.icio.us. New
posts will be tagged with links to the appropriate tag on my Del.icio.us
account and readers with Javascript enabled should see a list of
categories at the top of the right-hand column.

I'll need to experiment some more before I make up my mind just how
useful this'll be.
