title: Stupid, Noisy Pricks
---
Why are Internet/games places always full of noisy pricks? I'm sitting here waiting for my email to download, <a href="http://www.darwinports.org/">DarwinPorts</a> to update, some torrents to download and I don't think it's too much to ask that I not have to listen to two intellectually challenged individuals not scream at each other (in spite of the fact that they are sitting right next to each other).

I hate gamers.
