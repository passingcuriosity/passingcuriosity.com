Today was the third day of <acronym>Professional Experience
One</acronym> and the other shoe dropped. Continuing with the material
I've planned, the first class ripped along, even those who were absent
yesterday and needed to catch-up.

The second class was another matter entirely. A number of them managed
to finish everything and I was <emph>really</emph> happy with three or
four of them in that we've managed to resolve their initial confusions
and get them to the point where they are completing problems quicker
than 90% of the class. Other students in this class managed to avoid
completing much at all, even when I was stood next to them trying to
find out if they needed assistance or were just being lazy. Some of this
is to be expected (they were distracted by an event being held after my
class), but I'm not sure how I'll be able to get through to them if
they're like this tomorrow.
