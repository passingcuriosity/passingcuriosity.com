title: Professional Studies Tutorial 1
---
In our first professional studies tutorial, we formed our Professional Learning Teams. The purpose of these teams is to give us a small group (a total of five people) with whom to discuss what happens during our school placements.

My team consists of:<ul>   <li>T (me) -- secondary <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> and Technology and Design;</li>   <li>P -- English and <acronym title="Studies of Society and Environment">SOSE</acronym>;</li>   <li>K<sub>1</sub> -- Primary education;</li>   <li>C -- Design and Technology (I didn't get C's other specialisation down); and</li>   <li>K<sub>2</sub> -- SOSE and <acronym title="Languages Other Than English">LOTE</acronym>.</li></ul>Next week, we have a two hour tutorial to get acquainted with <acronym title="School University Partnership Programme">SUPP</acronym> and the next five or six weeks we'll be spending every Monday in a school.
