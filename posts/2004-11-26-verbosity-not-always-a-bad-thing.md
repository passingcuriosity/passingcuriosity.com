It appears that we need to set `very_verbose` to get the prover to output
clauses generated by factorisation, etc. Without this, we get only 5 clauses
from LCL403 instead of the nearly 30,000 expected.

Playing with the dumps from SET012, it becomes apparent that using clustered
subgraphs may be useful. When a large inter-rank gap is used with clustered
subgraphs for iterations, the resultant plot is almost understandable. Further
experiments to try include:

* creating edges between a given clause and its cluster of children (rather
  than a given clause and every child);

* collapsing nodes introduced by 'factor' into their parents; and

* correctly ordering the iteration clusters with respect to each other.

Creating "given" edges to clusters (instead of to all children) appears to be
of some value. Perhaps it might be interesting to represent this differently
in an animation: e.g. highlighting the current "given clause" during those
frames that comprise an iteration.
