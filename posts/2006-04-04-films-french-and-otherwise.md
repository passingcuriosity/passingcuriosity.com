I've watched a couple of good films recently. First, a couple French films distributed in Australia by <a href="http://www.madman.com.au/">Madman Films</a>.

<a class="title" href="http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?releaseId=1731&method=view">The Dinner Game</a> (or <span class="title">Le Diner De Cons</span>) is a wonderful comedy about a yuppy and the man who was to be his guest to an "idiots dinner." This is a fabulous film and everyone, lover of farce or not, should see it.

<a class="title" href="http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?releaseId=5667&method=view">Tais Toi</a> (<a href="http://www.taistoi-lefilm.com/flash/index.html">Official site</a>). The description on the Madman site is better than anything I could come up with, though it does spoiler the entire plot. Starring Gerard Depardieu and Jean Reno, this is one of the best films I've seen this year.

<a class="title" href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/mirrormask/">MirrorMask</a> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366780/">IMDB</a>) sees Helena transported from her own life (travelling and performing in her family's circus) into another world. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0503060/">Stephanie Leonidas</a> makes a wonderful heroine and her engagement with the almost entirely artificial world around her is testament to her ability as a actor. While the prevalence of special effects was a little overwhelming and the characters did occasionally seem a little detached from the mostly animated world around them, the art and design was absolutely gorgeous. Graphic artists and anyone who like Neil Gaiman's work would do well to see this film.
