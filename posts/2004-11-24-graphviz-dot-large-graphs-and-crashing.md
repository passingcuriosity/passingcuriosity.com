title: Graphviz, Dot, Large Graphs and Crashing!

excerpt: Running GraphViz on my generated dot files exhausts memory and dies.
  I'll need to either use a smaller problem, or another visualisation tool.

I came in this morning to discover that the Graphviz run with LCL005
consumed some nine and one quarter hours of real time and was killed,
I can only assume, due to memory usage. Hacked up a simple C program
to replace the shell script in converting "^clause" lines from
`runtime_data.dump` to 'dot'. It removes duplicate parents, outputs
them in ascending id order, etc. It's also a lot quicker than the
shell script.

One of the smaller problems (SET012) ran in a rather short amount of
time, and generated a graph that renders to 19616Ã—809px in PNG. It
will probably be a good idea to keep working with this problem due to
its smaller graph. GRP024 also runs much quicker than LCL005 (though
it still takes quite a lot longer than SET012).

Approaches may be:

* Assign explicit ranks based on the iteration the clause was generated in
  then try to find a radial layout filter;

* Have a `style=invis` central node, with edges to every other node, where
  each edge is weighted inversely proportionally to the iteration the clause
  was generated in (higher weights tend to shorter and straighter).

* Explicitly setting node ranks to the iteration number seems
  "cleaner" to me. Another alternative is to "declare" all nodes to
  be in clusters, then define the edges between them. It would then be
  possible to use the cluster ranking options to let Graphviz have
  more control over the layout.

Another problem is that the prover does not appear to be able to
provide enough information for my purposes. It does not appear to
expose individual events (clause creation and deletion) or any
information on clauses beyond the clause selected as "given" during
each iteration.

### Later still: ###

> It looks like `proc_gen()` is breaking clauses before we get them.
> For example, the parents of a clause are printed (very_verbose),
> followed by a message "Subsumed by ?", then out "** DELETED" message
> no longer has access to the clauses parents. The problem was caused
> by using a copy of the clause that was made before being passed to
> `proc_gen()` which has the side effect, apparently, of adding the
> parents list to the clause structure.

### Even Later: ###

> A trace of proving the theorem SET012 with the appropriate options
> enabled (print_kept, print_deleted, etc) is 2.3M in total, of which
> all but 32K is useful event data.
