  Some notes about Barcamp Perth 3.0.
---

I'm currently at [Perth Barcamp 3](http://barcamp.port80.asn.au/Main/BarCamp3) waiting for things to kick off. During the course of the day, I'll be posting notes and links on the sessions I attend. 

Thankfully, we're in a great venue (thanks to Central TAFE), plenty of people (thanks to Perth's awesome community), we're going to have food (thanks to the awesome sponsors) and it's lining up to be a pretty good day.

Matt thanked the sponsors and helpers.

We need to be out by 16:30. Coffee from 5Senses and pizza and subway for lunch. CentralTAFE providing the venue and internets for free, so we need to be good. No torrenting and clean up this afternoon. 

The Twitter tag is `#bcperth09`, bcperth09, barcamp, barcampperth3 and peoples names on Flickr, blogs, etc.

The program is online at http://barcamp.mattdidcoe.com/
