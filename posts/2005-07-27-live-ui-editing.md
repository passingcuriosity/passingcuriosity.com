Some language communities (CommonLisp is probably the largest, most obvious example) are used to incremental development, live updates, online bug-fixing and the many other benefits of a language with a REPL.



Mike Austin is currently working on bringing some of this style of development to the GUI arena with his work on <a href="http://mike-austin.com/blog/2005/07/live-ui-editing-update.html">Live UI Editing</a>. Hopefully he'll release a demo in the not too distant future.
