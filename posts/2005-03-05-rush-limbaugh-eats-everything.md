<a href="http://www.e-sheep.com/rusheats/">Rush Limbaugh Eats Everything</a>

For all the fact that this is funny, I can't help but feel that it is more
truth than fiction. I know people who accept and make arguments just like those
made by Rush in this comic. It scares me that there are human beings in
industrialised, progressive nations with access to some of the best education
systems the Earth has ever seen (to our knowledge) that still cannot understand
the simplest of arguments.

That there are people like Rush and his fellow neocons (or whatever they call
themselves) is, in my opinion, just as much evidence of humanities origins as
the fossil records and emerging genomic data.
