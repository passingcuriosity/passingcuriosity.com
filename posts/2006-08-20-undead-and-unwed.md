[![Undead and Unwed][0-1]][0-2]

I've just finished reading [Undead and Unwed][1] by [MaryJanice Davidson][2]
(who has [a blog][3]), the first in her *Undead* series. It was a good read and
it is certainly an interesting departure from the other books in this genre
I've read (though Betsy did remind me of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse).

I'm not sure if the next book will continue the theme (judging by the excerpt,
I think not), but Betsy brought to mind David Eddings' description of his hero,
[Garion][4], as a "[Sir Perceval][5]":

> Sir Perceval [...] is dumb -- at least right at first... A dumb hero is the
> perfect hero, because he hasn't the faintest idea of what's going on, and in
> explaining things to *him*, the writer explains them to his reader.

In any case, I'll definitely have a look at the rest of Davidson's books.
