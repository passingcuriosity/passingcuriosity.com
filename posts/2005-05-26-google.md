I'm currently reading up on Google so that I can prepare my presentation on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&cluster=726238533241861127" style="font-style: italic;">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine by Brin and Page</a>. This paper describes the original implementation of the Google search engine (originally <a href="http://google.stanford.edu">http://google.stanford.edu</a>, but that is now Stanford's search engine, powered by Google though it may be).

I'm going to try to cover the original Google architecture described in the paper, and then move on to some more modern material from the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&cluster=12528813212514513702" style="font-style: italic">Google File System</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&cluster=13171193432274178825" style="font-style: italic">MapReduce</a> papers, though I'm not sure how much detail I'll be able to give.

Depending on how useful they wind up being, I might put my report and slides on-line.
