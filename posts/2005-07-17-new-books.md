I've just bought two new books: <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/"
style="font-style: italic;">Freakonomics</a> and <a
href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521663504"
style="font-style: italic;">Purely Functional Data Structures</a>.

I'll read PFDS fairly immediately (as I'm hoping it'll help me with my
honours project), but I've got a feeling that Freakonomics is going to
have to wait a while.
