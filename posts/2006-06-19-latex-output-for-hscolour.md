On a somewhat related subject to my last post (<a href="http://interestingexperience.blogspot.com/2006/05/wanted-latex-packages.html">the one about LaTeX</a>), I've just started working on adding LaTeX support to <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/darcs/hscolour/">hscolour</a>. The structure of the program has made it easy to add support for LaTeX output: all I had to do is add two items to a pattern match (for option handling), and define a function to render the code to LaTeX (plus a few helpers to escape LaTeX special characters, <emph>etc.</emph>).

Once I've managed to get it working adequately, I'll submit a darcs patch to the maintainer.
