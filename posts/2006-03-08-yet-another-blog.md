title: Yet Another Blog
---
I've just started yet another blog: <a href="http://thsutton.wordpress.com/">The Education of an Educator</a>. As the title might suggest, this new blog will focus on the classes, discussions, readings and experiences I have during my training as a teacher. All of the relevant posts I've made here are already posted there, as is some new material, so go and have a look.

<strong>Update:</strong> the new blog has now been deleted and the content (what there was) migrated back here. Wordpress may be nice, but it failed to save drafts and make posts one too many times, especially when compared with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> which has not yet failed me once. The only thing that Blogger lacks over Wordpress is categories, and I could emulate those with Technorati or Del.icio.us if I could be bothered.
