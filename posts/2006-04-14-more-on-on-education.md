![On Education](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0415327903.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)

An already [noted](/2006/on-just-education/), I recently purchased Harry
Brighouse's new book [On Education][book] and I've just now finished reading
the first two chapters. These present arguments supporting the propositions
that:

1. We ought to education students to be autonomous (i.e: capable of deciding
upon a way of life that suits them; able to follow such a way of life; etc.);
and

2. We ought to educate students so that they are able to engage with
the economy, and not to fulfill certain economic needs.

The ease with which I have been able to engage with the material covered in
spite of my rather limited knowledge of philosophy (of education, or otherwise)
is testament to the clarity of Brighouse's presentation. If the other books in
the [series][series] are as interesting (and the certainly appear to be), I'll
have to look into getting some of them.
