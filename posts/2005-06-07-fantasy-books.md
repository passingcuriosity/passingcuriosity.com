I've just started reading Traci Harding's latest book: [The Gene of Isis][1]
and it looks like it'll be another great read.  While I loved *The Ancient
Future Trilogy* (on Kindle: [The Ancient Future: The Dark Age][2], [An Echo In
Time: Atlantis][3], and [Masters Of Reality: The Gathering][3]) and [The
Alchemist's Key][6] ([or on Kindle][5]), the books in her *Celestial Triad*
series left me a little somewhat disenchanted (what with the much thicker
miasma of "New Age" that permeates those books), so much so that I didn't
bother reading *Ghostwriting* or *Book of Dreams*.

Happily her latest work, if the rest of the book is at all like the first few
pages, seems to have taken a less grating approach to the supernatural. The
prologue, an entry from the journal of a character, has about it a charm
reminiscent, to my mind at least, of the era in which it is set. The odd turn
of phrase seems a little *too* modern, but the overall effect is most pleasing.

If you like fantasy, and are not averse to a bit of incarnation-hopping, then
I'd thoroughly recommend giving Traci Harding a read.

On a related note, Voyager are celebrating their 10th birthday. Part of this
(see the link) is a book containing a "sneak peek" of some of this years new
books. I'm looking forward to a number of them, especially Trudi Canavan's new
book: [Priestess of the White][7], due for release in November.

Another book on my list of eagerly awaited new titles is Katherine Kerr's new
book: [The Gold Falcon][8]. There are [two][9] [excerpts][10] available on her
web site.
