<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0829401121/102-7736613-0787310?v=glance"><span class="title">Latin Grammar</span> by Robert J. Henle</a>

I seem to be racking up more and more mathematical reading material. I just bought a copy of <span class="title">Numbers, Groups and Codes</span> from the Co-op Bookshop and have found the first few sections surprisingly readable. I hope that the rest of the book is as good as what I've read so far.

Another mathematical work near the top of my "<span style="font-weight:bold;">to read</span>" pile is <span class="title">A Gentle Introduction to Category Theory</span> (and, at some point, his Ph.D. thesis - <span class="title">Law and Order in Algorithmics</span>).

I also picked up (also from the Co-op) <span class="title">Latin: First Year</span> and <span class="title">Latin Grammar</span>. Along with <span class="title">Types and Programming Languages</span>, <span class="title">Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming</span>, <span class="title">Practicle Common Lisp</span> and the assorted other and papers (especially the various Haskell papers I want to read), I've got more than enough to keep me studying for most of next year).
