<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052154050X"><span class="title">Numbers, Groups and Codes (2nd ed.)</span> by J. F. Humphreys (University of Liverpool) and M. Y. Prest (University of Manchester)</a><br /><a href="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~fokkinga/mmf92b.html"><span class="title">A Gentle Introduction to Category Theory - the calculational approach</span> by Maarten M Fokkinga</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0829410260/102-7736613-0787310?v=glance"><span class="title">Latin: First Year</span> by Robert J.

Henle</a><br /><br />I seem to be racking up more and more mathematical reading material. I just bought a copy of <span class="title">Numbers, Groups and Codes</span> from the Co-op Bookshop and have found the first few sections surprisingly readable. I hope that the rest of the book is as good as what I've read so far.<br /><br />Another mathematical work near the top of my "<span style="font-weight:bold;">to read</span>" pile is <span class="title">A Gentle Introduction to Category Theory</span> (and, at some point, his Ph.D. thesis - <span class="title">Law and Order in Algorithmics</span>).<br /><br />I also picked up (also from the Co-op) <span class="title">Latin: First Year</span> and <span class="title">Latin Grammar</span>. Along with <span class="title">Types and Programming Languages</span>, <span class="title">Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming</span>, <span class="title">Practicle Common Lisp</span> and the assorted other and papers (especially the various Haskell papers I want to read), I've got more than enough to keep me studying for most of next year).
