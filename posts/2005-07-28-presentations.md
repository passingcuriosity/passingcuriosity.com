I have to give my mid-term seminar tomorrow afternoon and I'm getting rather nervous about it.<br /><br />My supervisor has told me that my slides aren't accessible enough (i.e. I require too much prior knowledge), but I can't see any way to simplify things or remove content without missing important things. I'm not happy, but I don't the time fine-tune it any more.<br /><br />If you're at the ANU (I'm not sure if the public is allowed) and free tomorrow at 1:00 (my presentation is at 1:26), come along to the <a href="http://campusmap.anu.edu.au/displaybldg.asp?no=108">Department of Computer Science</a> seminar room (N101) and watch me embarrass myself.
