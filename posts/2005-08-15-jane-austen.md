I've just started reading *Mansfield Park* by Jane Austen. I got an etext from
the <a href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/">eBooks@Adelaide</a>
collection of free web books at the University of Adelaide Library.

It's a great resource for anyone interested in the classics (I've put their
editions of Austen's and the Bronte sisters' books on my to-read queue).
