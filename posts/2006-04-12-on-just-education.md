[Justice][1] and [On Education][2], both by [Harry Brighouse][3]

My first Harry Brighouse book, *Justice*, left me with a bit of a bad taste in
my mouth. While the text is well written, accessible and far from dry; the
content is interesting and the design is reasonably attractive, what I have
read of it so far (about 60 pages) gives the impression that it has not enjoyed
the benefit of a copy editor, or even spell and grammar checked in a word
processor. Needless to say, this detracts somewhat from the impression of
scholarly rigour.

While Justice was an impulse purchase (motivated by recognition of his name
from a [blog][4] I read), my buying *On Education* was a more deliberate
selection -- motivated not only by my enjoyment of Brighouse's writing, but a
nascent (or emerging, I'm not sure which) interest in education and its
philosophy. From a quick flick through, I get the impression that this book
will have much higher production values than Justice did and, hopefully, won't
have contain the same evidence of a lack of copy editing.

Along with On Education, I also bought [Teachers, students & the law][5] and
[VectorWorks 10 For Windows & Macintosh][6], the former because it looked
interesting and was cheap, the latter because it was recommended and will come
in useful if I wind up teaching technical drawing.
