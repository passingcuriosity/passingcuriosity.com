I've been thinking about trying to learn another language for a while now. I'd
really like to learn <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language">Welsh</a>, but I think that
I'm going to start with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>. As in all
things, I think that the best way to go about picking up a new skill is
probably to start with something I'm familiar with and two years of French at
primary school have made me much more familiar with it than <a
href="http://deverry.com/">Katherine Kerr's books</a> have done for my
knowledge of Welsh; my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">anime</a>
habit has done for Japanese; or a few years of lessons at high-school did for
Indonesian.

After a little bit of searching, I found the <a href="http://frenchecole.libsyn.com/">'French for Beginners' podcast</a> from <a href="http://www.thefrenchecole.com/">the French Ecole</a>. I'll post a review after I've listened to a few episodes.
