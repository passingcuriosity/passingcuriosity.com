[Megatokyo: 683 Crazy Talk][1]

I've just caught up with Megatokyo (I'm between bank cards, so I've not been
able to put any money on my 'Net account at home) and, for some reason, the
last two or three strips have me left me feeling a bit weird. For one, I didn't
realise that Largo and Erika were "together" although I suppose playing games
together a while back was a bit of a hint. For two, it seems to me (and I'll be
way out, due to my social ineptitude) the Largo is being a prick, which makes
me sad for Erika.

PS: I've ordered books two and three from the local comic shop, book two is in
(and waiting only for me to have access to money) and I hope book three won't
be too long.
