[Java Programming Language, JDK 5](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/)

I was just digging through the [Java 5.0 API docs][1] and found my way to the
description of the latest language enhancements. The changes to the language
in JDK 5 (nee 1.5) are seriously cool. The descriptions of the new features
and constructs read like a who's-who of modern language features:

[1]: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/

* typed-checked generics

* a useful `for` loop

* static imports

* useful enums

* annotations.

Java is growing up. The for-each style loop and typed generics, as much as I
dislike the `<>` syntax, will significantly improve the experience of
programming in Java and the comprehensibility of the resultant code. Static
imports, annotations and enums are, in my opinion, more open to abuse, but
with discipline they too will make Java a much more attractive language to
code in.

I can't help but wonder how long it will take these features to filter into
programming and software engineering courses.
