I'm currently sitting in a lecture about inclusion and inclusive schooling. We're discussing a case-study about a primary school class and approaches that we might take to differentiating our curriculum and practice for students with disabilities. In particular we're considering a hypothetical student with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome">Down Syndrome</a> in a grade 5/6 class. We've had some interesting points raised including the inherent inclusivity of the <a href="http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au/references.htm#ELsresources">Essential Learnings</a> and the possible effects of differentiating the curriculum (will we be, in effect, "dumbing down" the curriculum?).

More later.
