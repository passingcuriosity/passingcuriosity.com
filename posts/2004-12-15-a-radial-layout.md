excerpt: My first approach at generating a radial layout of the graph data
  logged by the theorem prover.

All of my work to date [*as is now reflected by back posts below*] has been on
two tasks:

1. generating runtime data dumps; and

2. experimenting with radial layout techniques.

Generating data has been relatively easy. The automated reasoning system (one
based on [SCOTT][1] I believe) already had the capability to output most of
the data I need (like some statistics and the generated clauses that are kept)
so I simply added the capability to output clauses that are discarded. After
the data has been generated, I have a whole heap of scripts in a number of
languages to translate it into a variety of formats, from CSV-like formats
suitable for generating graphs of various statistics (using GNUplot) to a
simple XML dialect which is then transformed into a number of others (for a
couple of graph rendering packages) to dot (the language [Graphviz][2] uses to
describe graphs).

On the radial layout front, I have been looking at papers describing a number
of visualisation toolkits and radial layout algorithms for graphs and trees.
I've modified a layout component from one of these toolkits ([prefuse][3]) to
display my data in a radial layout, where radial distance is proportional to
time. Unfortunately, this leads to very messy graphs like this one:

I'm going to try and simplify the dataset and see if that will help resolve
the problem. If not, I think we'll have to find another visualisation for the
data.
