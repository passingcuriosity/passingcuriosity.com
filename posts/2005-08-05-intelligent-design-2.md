<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/996_intelligent_design_not_accep_9_10_2002.asp">Intelligent Design</a> is dangerous. The thought that anyone, anywhere, could think of teaching this as <span style="font-style: italic;">fact</span> (which, in the scientific sense, implies some form of verifiability) is truly mind blowing. Have we not yet moved on from being frightened by thunder and lightning?

If science teachers were to <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/bush_endorses_intelligent_design_creationism/#c33489">stop teaching science and start teaching poetry</a> would that be a good thing? Why ought we ask (or allow) them to teach religion in science class?
