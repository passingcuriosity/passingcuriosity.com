title: More Tai Chi
---
For my second week of Tai Chi lessons (there are two a week), I've managed to remember the first few steps of the short version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Chi_Chuan">Tai Chi</a> (I'm not sure which style we're learning, but it might be the <span style="font-style: italic;">Combined 48 Forms</span>).

In addition to learning another step in the movement, we also learnt the fifth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Eight Brocades</span> which are exercises to strengthen the body and promote the development and circulation of Chi. The first fours aren't too bad, but the fifth (called "Shake the Head and Weave the Tail") wore me out. I'm still feeling it six hours later.
