title: Week One Roundup
---
With the first week of classes over, it looks as though I'm going to enjoy this degree: Professional Studies looks like it'll be interesting (especially the school experience aspect); Multi-Literacies won't be <emph>too</emph> bad; Technology will be an opportunity to do things I haven't really though about before (design in wood, etc.); and it's going to be interesting looking at ways to apply information technology to other curriculum areas in IT as well as the details of teaching IT in its own right.
