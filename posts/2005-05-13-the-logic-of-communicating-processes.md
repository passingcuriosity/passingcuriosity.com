title: The Logic of Communicating Processes
---
I saw a talk by Professor Robin Cockett last night on the topic of <span style="font-style: italic">The logic of communicating processes</span>. I've just finished making a <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/704">post to Lambda the Ultimate</a> about the talk and related papers, so hopefully we'll see some interesting discussion.
