Here's a roundup of the books that [my Goodreads account][1] tells me
I finished during 2015.

# Fiction

[Young Babylon by Lu Nei](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1477829997/) was
really good. It's great books like this that make me think I should
venture out of my genre ghetto more frequently and read more literary
fiction!

I'm not much of a mystery reader by I quite enjoyed the first two
books in Elizabeth Edmondson's *A Very English Mystery* series:
[A Man of Some Repute](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1477829342/) and
[A Question of Inheritance](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1503947858/).

Mary Robinette Kowal's *The Glamourist Histories* series is part
Regency drama part magic-wielding fantasy. Unlike most fantasy works
the magic in this world is more of a fine art than a practical or
learned concern and more the domain of accomplished young ladies than
swashbuckling adventurers or wise elders. It's this departure from the
norm that makes the series so interesting. I've only read the first
book [Shades of Milk and Honey](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BSSRN5S/)
but the rest of the volumes are on my to-read list.

I re-read the first two books of Naomi Novik's Temeraire
[His Majesty's Dragon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345481283/) and
[Throne of Jade](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345481291/). I quite like
these two books but the series wears on me as it goes on and I don't
think I've ever managed to finish the third book. Maybe it's something
about Napoleonic naval books because I had the same thing happen
reading the Hornblower books too.

Speaking of re-reading I read
[The Seeress of Kell](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345377591/), the fifth
and final book in David (and Leigh) Eddings' Mallorean series. These
books (the 12 novels proper and 1 of background material) have been
favourites of mine for around 20 years.

I read two of Katherine Kerr's story collections --
[Dark Magicks: Two Tales](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D2I7SUC/) and
[Deverry: Three Tales](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RM3K3BY/) -- which
were both good, but I'll read pretty much anything set in her Deverry
world. I also tried one of her newer 'urban fantasy'-ish series with
[Sorcerer's Luck](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E8T2AK2/). Set in some
contemporary North American city but with Nordic magic-y stuff, it was
better than the "sexy vampires" urban fantasy slop that's so popular
the last few years (thanks for that Laurell K. Hamilton) but not my
cup of tea.

## Mercedes Lackey

I read and reread a bunch of Mercedes Lackey books toward the end of
the year.

I reread the *Owl Mage Trilogy* (or *Darien's Tale*):
[Owlflight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0886778042/),
[Owlsight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0886778034/), and
[Owlknight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0886779162/); and *The Mage
Storms*: [Storm Warning](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0886776619/),
[Storm Rising](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0886777127/), and
[Storm Breaking](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0886777550/) (though I read
them in
[The Mage Storms Omnibus](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012O636CG/)).

I quite enjoyed a newer series *The Collegium Chronicles*:
[Foundation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MLDUEGY/),
[Intrigues](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MLDKDBK/),
[Changes](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MLDUAQI/),
[Redoubt](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MLDT9E2/),
[Bastion](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MLDT75S/). The two books in the
follow-on series *The Herald Spy Trilogy* have been not quite as good
so far: [Closer to Home](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O520NO2/) and
[Closer to the Heart](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016AJS2AE/).

Leaving Valdemar, I find Lackey's *Elemental Masters* series a bit hit
and miss but I quite enjoyed
[Blood Red](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756409853/). Think Red Riding
Hood hunts werewolves, vampires, and other rogue magicians.

## Science Fiction

[Engineering Infinity by Charles Stross]()

[Flash by L.E. Modesitt Jr]()

# Non-fiction

[The Noticeably Stouter Book of General Ignorance](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AP9LP6/)
by John Lloyd was entertaining, as is the *No such thing as a fish*
podcast produced by the QI elves which I mentioned in my recent
[recommended podcasts](/2015/recommended-podcasts/) post.

[The Shochu Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M16V1J0/) by
Christopher Pellegrini was an interesting introduction to shochu (a
form of distilled spirit from Japan). It induced me to try the little
bottles of shochu I've had since I visited Japan in 2011.

[The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393347281/)
by Dona Wong is an introduction to *real* infographics -- charts,
diagrams, etc. -- for journalists and the like. If you need to produce
real infographics and are *not* a designer you'll likely find this
useful.

[Philosophical Letters by Voltaire](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0486426734/)
was by turns interesting and tedious. I don't think I'll bother
reading any more Voltaire.

## Short

[On Rumours by Cass Sunstein](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0063GJMVS/)
describes the way in which rumours arise and are spread. I think it
would have been improved with more discussion of empirical results but
it was interesting nonetheless.

I managed a few of Black Inc.'s series of essays Short Black mostly as
a late-December attempt to reach my target of 50 books. Alas, I
haven't made it but the three Short Blacks I read were pretty good
[No Fixed Address by Robyn Davidson](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XKJCUH4/),
[The Australian Disease by Richard Flanagan](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006AWP9BW/),
and especially
[Fat City by Karen Hitchcock](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XIXGOLA/),
[Booze Territory by Anna Krien](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XIXGOHE/),
and
[The Brave Ones: East Timor, 1999 by John Birmingham](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XIXGOYW/).

[Gods of Metal by Eric Schlosser](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010CFWEME/)
describes the remarkable success of the Plowshares movement at
breaking into various military bases, storage facilities, missile
silos, ships, hangers, and other parts of the US nuclear weapons
military-industrial complex. I'd ordinarily have skipped this --
expecting a breathless accounting of megatons and MIRVs and
death-tolls -- but the focus was very much on the activists and it was
a great read.

I quite liked
[A Cup of Sake Beneath the Cherry Trees by Kenko](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R730F2Q/)
and
[The Life of a Stupid Man by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T8S1GHG/)
from Penguin's Little Black Classics series but found the
[Goethe](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TAF8102/) and
[Sappho](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T8NUF8M/) volumes tedious.
