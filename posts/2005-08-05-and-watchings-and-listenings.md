title: And Watchings and Listenings...
---
I've just added another "W" and an "L" to the name of this blog to stand for "Watching" and "Listening". "Watching" has been added due to the fact that I've <a href="http://troacss.blogspot.com/2005/07/that-w-is-now-for-watching-too.html">reviewed</a> some anime before and am likely to do so again. "Listening" has been added in anticipation of my next post, a review of an album.
