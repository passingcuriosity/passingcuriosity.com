As I'm on a roll of posts about anime, books, blog-posts and the like, I've
decided to branch out into music as well. My first post on music (this one) is
a bit of a review of the album [Vendetta][1] by [Throwdown][2] (released in
Australia by [Road Runner Records][3]).

It's a solid metal album, heavy on the guitars and drums, with powerful vocals.
While it is good and will be going on my play list, there isn't *too* much, in
my opinion, to differentiate it from the offerings of acts like [Killswitch
Engage][4], [American Head Charge][5] (thought tend to be slightly more
melodic) and [Fear Factory][6].

In short: kick-ass metal, but not *too* inspired.
