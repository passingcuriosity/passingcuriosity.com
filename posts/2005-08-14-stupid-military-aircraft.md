title: Stupid Military Aircraft

There is some stupid air show going on (part of the <a href="http://www.dva.gov.au/commem/2005/VP/VP_Day/Index.htm">Salute to Veterans</a> I think) here in Canberra. There have been helicopters flying around fairly persistently for the last couple of days, but they aren't too hard to ignore. Today, however, there have been fighter jets flying over the lake and making enough noise to disturb that part of the  city situated around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Burley_Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>.

If they want to salute veterans, why can't they do so quietly and without burning huge amounts of fossil fuels?
