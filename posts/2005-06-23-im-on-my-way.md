The mid-semester holiday starts, for me, when I submit my second report for <span style="font-style: italic;">Milestone Papers in Computing</span>, that is, tomorrow morning. Rather than spend the next few weeks in cold, wet Canberra, I'm going to wet, cold Tasmania.

While I'm there, my Internet access will be rather limited and I hope, in-spite (or perhaps because of) this, to get <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/goals-motivation-of-procrastination.html">a lot of work</a> done on my honours project.
