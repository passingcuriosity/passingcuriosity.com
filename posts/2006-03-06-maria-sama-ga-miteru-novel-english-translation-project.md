Some of my favourite anime and manga are based on Japanese novels which can be
quite frustrating: anime and manga are accessible by dint of fan translation
efforts, but translations of novels is pretty rare. That is why Geoff
Zichterman's [Maria-sama ga Miteru Novel English Translation Project][1] is so
awesome: he has managed (with assistance) to translate the entirety of the
[first volume][2] of KONNO Oyuki's *Maria-sama ga Miteru*.

This has inspired me to make a somewhat belated new-years resolution: by the
end of 2006 I hope to be able to read this book in Japanese.
