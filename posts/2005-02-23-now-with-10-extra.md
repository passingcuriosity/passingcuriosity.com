So my first week of classes as an Honours student is well underway and I can't
help but feel that it was just a little anti-climactic. Classes, as far as
I can tell, won't be too much better than they were doing a Bachelor degree. On
the plus side, COMP4100 Managing Software Quality looks like it'll be
interesting. The AI unit (COMP4710) looks like it will be interesting: my
previous studies in AI had a more symbol processing oriented approach, whereas
COMP4710 is going to be taking an agent-systems oriented approach.

The other courses I'll be doing include "Milestone Papers in Computing"
(COMP4200) and "Advanced Algorithms" (COMP4700). I haven't had a lecture for
either of these units as COMP4700 doesn't start until next week and I have
a feeling that I missed the first lecture of COMP4200.

On top of that lot, I had to buy some clip-on sunglasses today because I went
to the Union courtyard to grab some lunch and it was painful to have my eyes
open due to the glare and general brightness. On the good side, I got two new
books today (the texts for AI and Algorithms) which was good, even though they
cost nearly $200, even with the Co-op members discount.

I've also started reading up on my Honours topic. I've written a [little bit
about it][1] on my reading blog.
