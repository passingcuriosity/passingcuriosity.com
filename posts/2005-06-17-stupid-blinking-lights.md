title: Stupid Blinking Lights
---
I have never liked strobing lights. From flashing on the TV screen, to lights at clubs, flashing lights make me uncomfortable. I doubt that it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_epilepsy">photosensitive epilepsy</a>.

Lately, I've been irritated by the banner adds for the US Green Card Lottery (or whatever it is called). For some reason, someone has decided that a large blinking red/yellow block would be the best way to advertise the Green Card Lottery (which, in my opinion, has to be the single stupidest way to manage an immigration system). 

I'm not sure if it has effected any photosensitive epileptics, but it sure as hell shits me off something chronic!
