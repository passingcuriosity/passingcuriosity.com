I just received a spam (regarding lifestyle medication) with the following as its filter-avoidance random text...
<blockquote>I like the word 'indolence.' it makes my laziness seem classy.
Gossip is sometimes referred to as halitosis of the mind
What's another word for Thesaurus?
Money is good for bribing yourself through the inconveniences of life.</blockquote>Perhaps spam is turning over a new leaf and attempting to contribute something back to the Internet, even if it is a few bad jokes that only a person such as myself would find amusing.
