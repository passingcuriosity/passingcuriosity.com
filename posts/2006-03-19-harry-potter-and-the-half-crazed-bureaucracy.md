[Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy][1] by Benjamin H. Barton.

An interesting paper from the Michigan Law Review. The author interprets the
Harry Potter books as presenting a particular view of government
(libertarianism) based on J. K. Rowling's rendering of her fictional Ministry
of Magic. The structure, corruption and abuses by the Ministry of the populace
(and Harry and his friends in particular) are presented, if I recall correctly,
as an allegoric parallel of the U.S. and U.K. governments. I'm not sure how
much of this aspect of J.K.R.'s work is intentional but, Barton's analysis is
certainly compelling (even if I don't agree with the politics of conclusions he
reaches).
