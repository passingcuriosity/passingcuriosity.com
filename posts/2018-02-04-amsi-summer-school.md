  I've spent the last four weeks attending the 2018 AMSI Summer School
  in the Mathematical Sciences at Monash Univeristy. Here's a quick run down.

The [Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute][1] 2018 [Summer
School in the Mathematical Sciences][2] at [Monash University][3] has
just finished. I took the [topological data analysis][5] and
[low-dimensional topology][6] courses.

Topological data analysis
=========================

Topological data analysis is a field which uses ideas and techniques
from topology to analyse and characterise data sets. This course
covered a lot of ground quite quickly:

We can approximate a topological space by simplical complexes (which
is closely related to the familiar triangulation used

Using simplical complexes to represent topological spaces and
computing their homology.



- Simplical complexes and computing them from data
- The homology of simplical complexes
- Persistent homology, which is the main tool of TDA
- Comparing persistence diagrams (the space of persistence diagrams)
- Statistical analysis of persistence diagrams (monte carlo simulation)
- Some applications

- Functional summaries of persistence diagrams (rank, landscape,
  persistence image)
- Functional principal component analysis (FPCA)
- Union-Find for connected components
- Kruskal's algorithm for MST
- Smith Normal Form for computing the boundary matrices
- An incremental algorithm for computing Betti numbers
- An algorithm to compute persistent homology by pairing simplicies

- Morse theory for smooth manifolds
- Discrete Morse theory

Social events
=============

- A reception
- A closing dinner.
- A diversity session and panel discussion.
- Morning tea every week day.
- BBQ lunch each Wednesday.
- A lunchtime lecture each Tuesday.
- A maths-related movie night on Thursday night.

- An excursion to the Philip Island and the penguin parade.
- An excursion to the Yarra valley to visit a winery or two.

- A tour of the [Monash University Wind Tunnel Facility][4]
