This is the last in a posting splurge I've had this afternoon: six paper posts have been added and one has been updated. I intend this to be the first in a series of weekly or biweekly session in which I post the papers I've been reading. Perhaps now that I'm studying education rather than computer science, I'll be able to get some more reading done.

Suggestions of papers to read are most welcome and can be sent by <a href="mailto:open.dialogue@gmail.com">email</a>.
