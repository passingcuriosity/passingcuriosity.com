title: An eclectic taste in music
---
<p>I bought two <acronym title="Compact Disc">CD</acronym>s from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mojo+music%22+launceston">Mojo Music</a> today. My selections (<span class="work"><a class="title" href="http://theblackparade.com/">The Black Parade</a> by <a class="author" href="http://mychemicalromance.com/">My Chemical Romance</a></span> and <span class="work"><a class="title" href="http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.555010">Beatles Go Baroque</a> &mdash; <span class="description">a CD of classical treatments of some of <span class="composer">the Beatles</span> most popular songs</span> &mdash; arranged by <span class="arranger conductor">Peter Breiner</span></span>) provoked a remark from the guy who served me about my having an eclectic taste in music. I can't imagine why. ?</p>
