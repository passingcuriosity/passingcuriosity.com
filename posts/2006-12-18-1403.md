I was thinking about how little I understand of type systems today -- I know
that they tend to be an embedding of a constructive logic, `Int` for example,
but I don't have any sort of intuitive understanding of what this actually
means. This is probably because I haven't done much with intuitionistic
logics.

I think that I'll start trying to get a better understanding of intuitionistic
logics by reading Eleanor Donovan's honours thesis: "[Automated Proof Search
in Bi-Intuitionistic Logic Using Sequent Calculi](ed)".
