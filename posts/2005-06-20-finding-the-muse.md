Recently I've been on a Harry Potter fan fiction trip. Specifically, I've been revisiting my fascination with Pumpkin Pie, or the Harry and Hermione "ship". While it has been wonderful rereading some of my favourite stories, I've also discovered some brilliant new stories.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Finding the Muse</span> is, while not strictly speaking Pumpkin Pie, one such gem. While lots of Harry/Hermione stories have plots reminiscent of <span style="font-style: italic;">Days of our Lives</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eastenders</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Home and Away</span>, this is a truly wonderful story that explores an aspect of Harry Potter's world that I, for one, had never even considered but not seems glaringly obvious: the lack of music.

I'm sure that echoes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Finding the Muse</span> will be appearing in my thoughts and writing on Harry Potter for a long while.
