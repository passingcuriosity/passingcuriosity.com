Talk by Paul Faix.

Biggest things at the start: confidence that you can deliver on your promises, and marketing; both are a problem as a one-man-band just getting starting.

Used <a href="http://businesscatalyst.com/home">BusinessCatalyst</a>, a hosted CMS solution which allows you (makes it easy) to re-brand it. You can brand it, and take it to your customers. Gives confidence of having a solution (that's branded as yours). Using this system, projects generally take three days:

<ol>
    <li>Design: making with the pretty pictures</li>
    <li>Implementing: not so much programming, as making use of existing modules, etc.</li>
    <li></li>
</ol>

His site is built using BusinessCatalyst: <a href="http://www.fortix.com.au/contact.htm">Fortix</a>. Showing us, per-region editing through the front-end (login, click on regions, edit in pop-up). Lot's of modules providing features like FAQs, blog, form submissions, CAPTCHA, CRM, etc., etc.

<h3>Questions...</h3>

<strong>Is there an API?</strong> Yes, you can, but it seems restricted. You can't code at all, but you can use a web-services API to exchange data with it.

<strong>How much is it?</strong> Ranges from $300--$900 annually. Paul's customers see it as amazing value for money, given that it's got workflow, roles, etc. Handles e-mails, etc.

<strong>Can I have my data?</strong> There is an import/export interface. Not sure how much gets exported, but he mentioned Excel so maybe just the forms?
