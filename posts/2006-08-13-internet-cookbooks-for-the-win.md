Rather than buy a few cookbooks, or a guide to leather-work or knitting, I
usually hit the 'Net. For some reason, though, I often have difficulty finding
recipes for really basic things. All too often, <a
href="http://allrecipes.com/">All Recipes</a> won't have a simple no-frills
recipe or, more often, will have dozens and dozens of variations.

This is where sites like the <a
href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook">Wikibooks Cookbook</a> and <a
href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/">Cooking for Engineers</a> can come
in handy. Concise, clearly written instructions based on personal experience
(although wikibooks, like all things wiki, can be a mess of contradictory
information) with all the constraints so implied -- they are simple, realistic
and provide few, if any, endless variations on a particular theme.
