A while ago, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hack/">Hack</a> programme
on <a href="http://www.triplej.net.au/">JJJ</a> did a story on iPods. According
to one of the Apple service people they interviewed, the short battery life
that lots and lots and *lots* of people experience with an iPod is due to
excessive recharging.

Like most battery technologies, those used in the iPod will only last a certain
number of recharge cycles. Once that number has passed, the battery life begins
to decline. The obvious solution is the charge only when necessary. The obvious
problem with this solution is that my iPod charges automatically when it's
attached to my iBook.

My question then is, if we aren't supposed to charge unless necessary, and if
the iPod charges when connected to a computer, then why does iTunes have <a
