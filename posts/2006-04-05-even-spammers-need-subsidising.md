Even spammers, it would seem, need to subsidise their operations with
advertising. In the screen capture above, you can see that this Nigerian
scam email has a couple of ads (for Yahoo! messenger) appended to it.
This is probably the result of some bit of filth spammer sending their
message from Yahoo!'s web-mail service to an e-mail list instead of
doing the job properly. It appears as though spammers standards, low
though they have always been, are slipping.
