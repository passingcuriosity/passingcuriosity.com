A chain of thought typical of my mode of thinking (that is to say: tenuous and somewhat arbitrary) lead me to consider some connection between radioactive decay and the "moral decay" that some groups tend to harp on about. Coincidentally, an opinion piece in The Australian today reminded me of this absent thought and so I'll ponder the topic online (and in public) rather than leave it to its rest (as perhaps might be wise).

Radioactive decay is the process that atoms (or rather their nuclei) undergo transforming from unstable to stable forms. An unstable nucleus will emit a particle (alpha, beta or gamma) as it transforms into a more stable state (be it as a a lower energy form of the same element, or a different element altogether). Perhaps the idea of "moral decay" might be characterised in the same manner.

A society, in its development, transitions from unstable states (those in which the society is at risk of fracturing due to the ridiculous strictures it places on its members) to more stable states (in which the society is more harmonious) by ejecting particles from its core values, i.e. by abandoning those mores likely to create division or to impinge on societal progress.

It was just a curious pondering but it is, perhaps, worth considering next time I hear a religious nut, right-winger, or RSL member holding forth on the "moral decay" of the "Youth of Today"...
