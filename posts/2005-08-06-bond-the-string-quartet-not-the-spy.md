I've just watched the <a href="http://www.bondmusic.net/discdvd.html">DVD</a> of <a href="http://www.bondmusic.net/">Bond</a> live at the Royal Albert Hall (which I bought on special at <a href="http://www.jbhifi.com.au">JB Hi-Fi</a> in Canberra). I normally don't like recordings of concerts and this DVD demonstrates most of the reasons.

First, and most importantly: the music. A lot has been said about Bond's music. It's been called "classical", "New Age", "crossover" and "pop" by various reviewers. They were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1300330.stm">banned</a> from the British classical music charts because their music isn't in the "classical idiom" and isn't by a recognised classical composer (I don't call myself an aficionado of classical music, but even I can recognise the sources of many of their songs). In spite of their use, sometimes a touch too heavy, of elements more reminiscent of dance and rock music, Bond's music is fantastic and the DVD of this concert isn't an exception. Far from the usual complaints of poor quality live recordings, the audio on the DVD is crystal clear and well mixed.

Second: the concert itself. While the music is great, the video is not. Some parts are awfully cut, with awkward, even amateurish, transitions between shots. The camera work is uninspired and uses a number of truly peculiar shots. One camera that is used <span style="font-style: italic;">way</span> too much is positioned on the ceiling above the stage focussed directly down. Another is the roof and balcony cameras. The video editors have done a great disservice to the music and the band.

Third: the menus and extras. The menus are well designed and easy to navigate. A few tricks might have been welcome (the photo-gallery might have benefited from the usual trick whereby one need only press a direction, rather than a direction and enter), but on the whole, pretty good. There are a number of extras included: an interview with Bond, two music videos, a small gallery of publicity shots and a quiz on the DVD and some a poster and ring-tones on the DVD-ROM. 

In short, the music is great, the extras are interesting and the menus are well presented. The only down note is the video which, while not bad, is not brilliant. If you're a Bond fan, I'd encourage you to get it. If you've been under a rock for the last couple of years and haven't heard them, you might like to think about it: at the place I bought it, this DVD is cheaper than the albums on CD.
