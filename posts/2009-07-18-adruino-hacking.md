[Trent "lathiat" Lloyd](http://lathiat.net/) (MySQL support engineer, Linux guy, avahi developer) talking about embedded hardware with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/).

<!--more-->

8-bit microcontroller with a bunch of ports. Can connect: thermister, leds, buttons, serials, light sensors (optoresistors).

Also: LCDs, 240v relays, hall effect (magnetic switches, RPMs, etc.), graphical LCDs, wirless comms, GPS, GPRS modem, etc.

Both analogue and digital I/O pins. 

Has a USB port for host control. Has an FTDI chip to do serial over USB. Power from USB or external DC power supply.

What to do with it?
============

[Geek my ride](http://www.geekmyride.org/) - use an Arduino (or laptop) to  talk to the computer in your car. Tuning, monitoring, etc. Trent's used it with his 1994 Magna. Pull out a fuse for power :-) Can monitor RPM, etc. from the car computer. It's a (relatively) standard protocol.

Slides and notes from this presentation are available at Trent's home page.
