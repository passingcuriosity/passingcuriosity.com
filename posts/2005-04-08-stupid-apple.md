As much as I love my iBook, want a iMac and find my iPod handy, I hate Apple.
I recently bought a [remote control for my iPod][1]. You know, the one that
goes in between the ear-phones and the iPod. The one with the clip to
conveniently attach it to your clothing so that you can get to it.

[1]: http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/72703/wo/NQ5mkcimnHtZ2vNjbMnFcx2NBju/1.0.0.11.1.0.6.9.3.19.0.1.0.1.1.1.1.0.3

As it is designed to be used in a manner that makes it susceptible to the
buttons being knocked, the Apple engineers put a hold switch on it, so that you
can disable the buttons while not in use. After less than a week of use, the
hold switch fell of my iPod remote control. While it was locked. Needless to
say, I was a little surprised.

Naively, I took my remote to the Apple store at which I purchased it. After
a bit of a wait (they were busy) one of the staff told me that I had to phone
Apple and gave me the number. When I phoned Apple, the telephone operator told
me (after a while on hold) that I needed to fill in a form on the Apple web
site and then take it and the item to be returned to Australia Post (what I do
with it then was left as an exercise for the reader). As annoying as this is,
I can accept that Apple is a big company and, as such, they need procedures
like these to get anything done.

What really shits me off, is that I can't submit the form on the Apple web site
because it requires credit card information. I don't have a credit card,
I don't want a credit card and if I did have a credit card, I most certainly
wouldn't give it to a company in these circumstances.

While I love Apple's computers and find my iPod and Airport Express base
station handy, I can't help but be appalled at:

1. the fact that a remote control, a device designed to be carried around,
broke after less than a week; and

2. that I need to enter my credit card details to return an item that, as I see
it, was not fit for the purpose for which it was sold.

I suppose that I need to phone the help line again to find out what I'm
supposed to do, but in the mean time, I can't help but resent it.
