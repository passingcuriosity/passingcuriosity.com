excerpt: 
  I've made a bit of progress hacking on this blog the last few nights...

I started this new incarnation of Passing Curiosity with stock
[Jekyll][mjj], the content [imported][mji] imported from my old
Wordpress blog, and [Mark Reid][mr]'s excellent Creative Commons
licenced [design][mrn].

I pared it back from Mark's more complex use case and reworked the templates
and stylesheets a bit to make them more HTML5-y, but there's still a way to
go. Eventually, I'd like to use the new [semantic tags][tag5] throughout and
make the design my own.

I tweaked the 404 page to (na√Øvely) extract the words from bad URLs and
pre-fill the Google search box. Still on the search engines theme I also added
an [XML Sitemap][smp] template -- which lists the index, archive, and every
post -- and a `robots.txt` which references it.

Following [Benjamin Thomas][bt]' [guide][btc] I now use a custom `jekyll`
command which loads extension code when processing the site (without having to
fork Jekyll itself). At the moment, this is just loading [Jack Moffitt][jm]'s
[`html_truncatewords`][jmt] filter.

[jm]: http://metajack.im/
[jmt]: http://github.com/metajack/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/filters.rb

The new filter is used in the index, archives, and Atom feed templates and the
`<meta>` tags to generate a description when a post does not have an excerpt.
I plan on extending the set of meta-data included in each page to include as
much of the [Dublin Core][dc] [Element Set][dces] as makes sense. Some of it
will come from the site and post YAML data, but others will need custom Liquid
tags to determine the correct values automatically.

In all, it's been a busy couple of evenings but Jekyll is refreshingly simply
and delightfully easy to start hacking with.
