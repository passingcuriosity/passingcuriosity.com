excerpt:
  I've deleted a few social media accounts.

I've recently discovered that using social media makes my life
moderately worse so I'm gradually deleting my accounts on the services
I've signed up to in the last two decades or so. So far I've deleted:

1. *Twitter* Because it is a massive time sink which has almost no real
   positive.

2. *Flickr* Because it's been sold again and I can't be bother deciding
   if I trust the new owners. And I haven't used it much for ages. I
   think I also got rid of my *Yahoo* account too, but it's hard to
   tell.

3. *Goodreads* Because I listen to audiobooks and want to keep track of
   them together with my e-books and paper books. Alas, they insist that
   a recording isn't an audiobook unless it was first published as a
   written book. 

I tried to delete my vestigial *Facebook* account but can't because I
would need to verify it first. I use private mode so I can't verify
myself using an already-logged-in computer and the
contact-a-few-of-your-friends method is out because I have no idea how
to contact most of the people it offered. Oh well, I'll just leave the
account locked.
