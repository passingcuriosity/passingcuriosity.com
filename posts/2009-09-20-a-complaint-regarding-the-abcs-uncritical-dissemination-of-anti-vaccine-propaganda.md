title: A complaint regarding the ABC's uncritical dissemination of anti-vaccine propaganda
---
Here is my complaint to the ABC regarding one of their recent articles regurgitating anti-vaccine propaganda from the AVN loons. 

> ABC News recently published an article titled "Vaccine could be 'more dangerous than swine flu'."
> 
>Judging by the title and text, the entire article appears to be nothing more than a credulous regurgitation of propaganda from a known anti-vaccine campaign group. The article contains direct quotes from only a single source -- Meryl Dorey, from the Australian Vaccine Network -- and even a cursory examination of the background of Dorey and her organisation shows that they are not only not a reputable source, but they about as biased a source as the author could find.
> 
> I find it worrying that the ABC is assisting the AVN -- by publishing their entirely discredited views -- to undertake behaviour that is the subject of a complaint to the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission, a fact that the ABC has itself mentioned in previous reports (http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/06/2647604.htm).
> 
> I hope that the ABC will take steps to ensure that future coverage of this and similar issues -- which, after all, may already be resulting in the preventable deaths of Australian children -- are based in fact obtained from credible sources. Continuing to spread such disinformation is, in my opinion, a discredit to the ABC and its audiences.
