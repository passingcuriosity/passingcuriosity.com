title: Project Description and Literature Review
---
We've passed the first milestone in the Honours program: project descriptions and literature reviews were due today. I'm fairly happy with mine. The literature review proper could have been improved, but I'm really happy with the background sections.

Writing it was fun! This is the first piece I've had to write that I've actually enjoyed writing for its own sake (and not for the adrenaline of starting to research an assignment 9 hours before it is due). Trying to describe modal logic and tableau systems concisely was a challenge!

If anyone is interested, I'll post a PDF after I check with my supervisor and the convenor that it is ok to do so.
