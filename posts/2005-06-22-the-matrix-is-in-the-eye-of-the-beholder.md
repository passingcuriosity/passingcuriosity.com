The <a href="http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/%7Ejon/NotYASS.html">NotYASS</a> <a href="http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/%7Ejon/NotYASS7.html">session on the Matrix</a> was interesting. A lot of people (or, rather, more than usual) showed up, including a lot of philosophers (from RSSS and the Department of Philosophy I suppose). There wasn't much more than the various points, arguments and objections raised in the various papers at <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">www.simulation-argument.com</a>, but the discussion was interesting.

I'll be missing the next session (I think it's been cancelled anyway due to a conference or some such), but there are a few more philosophical topics scheduled for the next few session after that. They should be interesting if nothing else.
