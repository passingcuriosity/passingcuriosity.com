Attending the [Logic Summer School][1] at the Australian National University
has encouraged me to continue my studies of formal logic begun with the unit
[HPA292: Logic and Philosophy][2] more informally on my own. To this end,
I purchased the Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science book [Modal
Logic][3]. My initial impressions are favourable, though I've not read much of
the book.

I'll expound here in further detail on the merits of this book at a later
time.
