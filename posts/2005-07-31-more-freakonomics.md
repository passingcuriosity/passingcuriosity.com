title: More Freakonomics...
tags: books

I've just finished reading <a
href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> and my overall impression
is that it could have done with an appendix on statistical analysis, regression
analysis in particular. The later chapters appeal to regression analysis a
number of times and the one serious lack is an explanation of what that means.

Readers familiar with statistical analysis will not find this a problem, but
this is not a book aimed at statisticians and economists. It is (as I see it) a
book aimed at the reader of popular science, the reading public. Such an
appendix might not have been bigger than the section of notes (some 21 pages),
but would be provide a lot more support, in the mind of the casual reader, for
the author's arguments and interpretations than the lists of citations,
references and sources.
