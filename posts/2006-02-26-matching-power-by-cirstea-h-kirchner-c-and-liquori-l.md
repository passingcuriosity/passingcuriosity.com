<a href="http://rho.loria.fr/data/rta2001.pdf" class="title" title="Matching Power">Matching Power</a> by Cirstea H, Kirchner C and Liquori L.

This is the first paper I've read about rewriting calculi and, if nothing else, it's made me want to read <a href="http://rho.loria.fr/papersGuidelines.html" title="Paper on the Rho Calculus">more</a>. In it, the authors provide an introduction to pattern matching, introduce the syntax and semantics of the &rho;-calculus, and present a number of compelling examples of its power. Section four is the most interesting part of the paper (the rest being primarily and introduction to the calculus): in it the authors present encodings of the <span class="title">Lambda Calculus of Objects</span> (Fisher, Honsell, and Mitchell) and the <span class="title">Object Calculus</span> (Abadi and Cardelli) into the &rho;-calculus.
