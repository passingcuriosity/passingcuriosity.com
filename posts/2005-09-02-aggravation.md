I've just finished the <a href="http://togaware.redirectme.net/access/assignment.html">second assignment</a> for the <a href="http://datamining.anu.edu.au/student/math3346_2005.html">data mining course</a> I'm doing this semester. The one thing I got out of it is a strong desire to avoid <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.

There is something about that language and system that just rubs me the wrong way. I have no idea how the type system (such as it is) works and any such understanding would be of little value (as it is dynamic anyway). I cannot understand how someone managed to write a <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml</a> <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/XML.html">wrapper</a> that is <emph>harder</emph> to use than the C library.

To make matters a little better, the <a href="http://ess.r-project.org/">ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)</a> package makes editing R code and interacting with the R interpreter easy, though emacs started acting peculiarly after I installed it.

All in all, R is (in my opinion, by my standards and for my purposes) something to be avoided.
