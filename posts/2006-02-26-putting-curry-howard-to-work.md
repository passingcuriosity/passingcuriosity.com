This paper describes some type system feature suggested by the
Curry-Howard isomorphism (which states that types are propositions and
that programs are their proofs). The language &Omega;mega is a
descendant of Haskell in which the author has implemented all of the
features described in the paper.

I still haven't finished reading it, but it's at the top of my pile.
