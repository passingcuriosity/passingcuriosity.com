title: A little bit on logic and trans-world identity

---

I've just posted a little bit about modal logic (more specifically the idea of
trans-world identity) to a message board I read. My post was in response to a
post in a thread about a story in which a character uses a portal to visit
herself in other worlds. The originating post, my reply and a follow-up by
personal message follow.

If anyone spots any glaring mistakes or omissions in the below, I would very
much appreciate having them pointed out in the comments (as though anyone will
read this).

**My reply:**

> speak of Daria from world n is the thing that is most similar to the actual
> Daria (i.e. the one we thing is "real"). All the "Daria"s are equally real,
> and completely unrelated, except through the counterpart relation.

> There are alternative views in which the Darias are all part of one
> trans-world object, a kind of Uber-Daria. This is called mereology (IIRC)
> and the various Darias are just world indexed parts of the trans-world
> Daria. This view is somewhat related to the idea of temporal identity (i.e.
> am 'I' the same thing that sat here yesterday and browsed this forum?). The
> temporal variant is pretty much the same (just replace "world" with "time"),
> but also a lot stronger as a person has some form of spacial continuity
> between instants (i.e. I'm pretty close to where I was from one instant to
> the next), whereas there is no continuity between objects at different
> worlds.

> Another view which might be taken into account is haecceity (literally,

> you'll forgive the pretension) that makes Daria-n identical to Daria-m, even
> if one is a person and the other a cement block. This is, needless to say, a
> little weird, but the whole concept of trans-world identity is a bit strange

**My follow-up by PM:**

Once again if anyone has any pointers to interesting material, comments or
criticisms of my explanations above, please feel free (I'd like to say
obliged, but you aren't) to post comments.

Additionally, this post wouldn't have been possible without the efforts of Dr.
James Chase to endow a class of undergraduates with some little (in my case at
least) understanding of modal logic during HPA292 - Logic and Philosophy.
