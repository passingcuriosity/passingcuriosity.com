title: A little bit on logic and trans-world identity
tags: logic, philosophy
---

I've just posted a little bit about modal logic (more specifically the idea of
trans-world identity) to a message board I read. My post was in response to a
post in a thread about a story in which a character uses a portal to visit
herself in other worlds. The originating post, my reply and a follow-up by
personal message follow.

If anyone spots any glaring mistakes or omissions in the below, I would very
much appreciate having them pointed out in the comments (as though anyone will
read this).

**My reply:**

Once again if anyone has any pointers to interesting material, comments or
criticisms of my explanations above, please feel free (I'd like to say
obliged, but you aren't) to post comments.

Additionally, this post wouldn't have been possible without the efforts of Dr.
James Chase to endow a class of undergraduates with some little (in my case at
least) understanding of modal logic during HPA292 - Logic and Philosophy.
