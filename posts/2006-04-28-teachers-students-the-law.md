I've just finished reading [Teachers, students & the law][1] by Andrew Hopkins
(published by the Victoria Law Foundation). It covers a number of legal issues
important to teachers and school staff including the duty of care, mandatory
reporting of abuse and rights and responsibilities. 

The thing that really surprised me in reading this book is that corporal
punishment may be permitted in schools in the Northern Territory and
non-government schools in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. I wonder
when these states will catch up with the rest and abolish corporal punishment
in schools altogether...
