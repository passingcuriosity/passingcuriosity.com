I picked up [Practical Common Lisp][pcl] from the Co-op Bookshop yesterday.
Looks promising. Now all I'm waiting for is [Types and Programming
Languages][tapl] (at the [Co-op Bookshop][coop]) and a bunch of comics (at
[Impact Comics][impact]).

Now I have four books to read...

Plus numerous papers...

I pity my eyes.
