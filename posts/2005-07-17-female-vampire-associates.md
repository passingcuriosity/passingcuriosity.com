title: Female Vampire Associates
tags: books, fiction, fantasy

I'm not sure how recent a development it is, but there certainly seem to be a
fair (and growing) number of books out there with female main characters who
"associate" with vampires and the supernatural. Laurell K. Hamilton's *Anita
Blake*, Tanya Huff's *Vicki Nelson*, Kelley Armstrong's *Paige Winterbourne*,
Charlaine Harris' *Sookie Stackhouse*, the list goes on (though I can't think
of any more off hand).

This type of book focuses on a female main character who is dragged into (or
perhaps is already a part of) the seedy underworld of the supernatural. Some of
these books (the [Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter][1] series for example) have a
gritty, realistic edge to them: the more or less human characters are caught up
in a whirlwind of violence and death managing to survive only by chance, by the
sufferance of monsters, or (by the skin of their teeth) by their own abilities.

Others of this genre (the [Sookie Stackhouse Vampire Mysteries][2] for example)
sport a softer, less harshly-realistic look at the denizens of the night and
their associates. Sporting just as many fatalities, these books offer a
lighter, more accessible and more palatable read.

I've only read the first two *Sookie Stackhouse* books, but I found them more
enjoyable, if slightly less intense, than the *Anita Blake* books. If you like
the Hamilton, Huff or Armstrong's books, you'll probably enjoy Charlaine
Harris' *Sookie Stackhouse Vampire Mysteries*.
