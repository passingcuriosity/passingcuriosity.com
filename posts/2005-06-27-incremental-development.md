title: Incremental Development
---
Incremental development is fun. I've just added support for branching as required to implement the disjunction and implication rules of my propositional calculus and it's been quite interesting to see just how easy a functional programming language makes with sort of exploratory approach to design and development.

Once I've got this up and running (all I need to do is add a check for contradiction), I'll refactor it to be a little neater, write a parser and generator that supports all of the features and get an initial, pre-alpha, demonstration version posted.

Hopefully that'll be in the next two or three days.
