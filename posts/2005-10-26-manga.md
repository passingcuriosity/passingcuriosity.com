I've recently (i.e. since my last post on manga) purchased a whole bunch of new
manga books. Today I got *The One I Love* by CLAMP (Tokyopop's translation of
*&#12431;&#12383;&#12375; &#12398; &#12377;&#12365;&#12394;&#12402;&#12392;*),
which is a great little book.

I've also got a whole bunch of Viz Media books including *Koko wa Greenwood*
(or *Here is Greenwood* in English), *Maison Ikkoku* books 1-5 (with 6-10 on
order) and *Hanazakari no Kimitachi e* (Viz, and everyone else, call it
*Hana-Kimi*).

I've bought so many books whilst here in Canberra that I'm going to have to get
them shipped when I leave (as opposed to taking them as checked luggage on my
flight home).

It seems that Western comics in the manga style are becoming popular. So much
so that Tokyopop are publishing an Australian artist's book! I can't wait to
see if [The
Dreaming](http://tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?propertycode=DRM&categorycode=BMG) is
as good as it looks.

PS: The Japanese input mode on Emacs (which I used to type the hiragana above)
is shit-hot. Much easier than trying to use the Japanese Kana Palette or any
other input method I've tried.
