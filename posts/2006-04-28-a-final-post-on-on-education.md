I've just finished [reading On Education][1] by Harry Brighouse. It is, without
exception, the most accessible, well written and well presented philosophical
work I have read.  This should be essential reading for everyone involved in
education; teachers, administrators, policy makers and the community at large.

The next time I have $30 to spare, I'm going to get [On the Public][2], another
volume in Routledge's series *Thinking in Action*.
