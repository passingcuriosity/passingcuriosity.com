I've just been looking for material on [The Shadow][1]. I've managed to find a
fan [novelisation][2] of the 1994 film staring Alec Baldwin which looks
promising and I already have a copy Dark Horse's book featuring [The Ghost and
The Shadow][3]. I'm going to try and find the film on DVD as it was absolutely
fantastic and I much prefer it to the original mythos (what I know of it).
