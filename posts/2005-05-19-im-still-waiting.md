I'm not sure what the hold-up is, but I am *still* waiting for my copy of
[Types and Programming Languages][1]. I do wish they'd hurry it up a little.

In other, some what related (in the sense that is also involves an order), news
I gave in to my primitive, lustful urges and ordered a 20-inch iMac.

In even more news some of the books I've had on order came in today. I have in
my hot little hands: [Ojo][2] and [Breakfast After Noon][3].
