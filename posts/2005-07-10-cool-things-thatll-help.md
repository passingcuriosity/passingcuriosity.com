In the cool things that will help implement this project, the Haskell Hierarchical Libraries contain a Graph library which supports querying the existence a path between specified nodes, just what I'll need to implement box rules.<br /><br />Another cool thing I need to look at more is the definition of "<a href="http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/xformerexamples.html#example24">a monad for stateful non-deterministic computations</a>" in the <a href="http://www.nomaware.com/monads/">All About Monads</a> tutorial. <br /><br />I need to learn more about monad transformers.
