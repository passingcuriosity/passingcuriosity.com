I've just been reading a bit of [Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer
Programming by Van Roy and Haridi][1] (aka CTM). As I often do, I've used the
receipt as a book mark (primarily because the bookshop staff put the receipt in
the book when I ask them not to put my purchases in a bag).

CTM cost me, after the Co-op members discount, $97. [Haskell 98 Language and
Libraries: the Revised Report][2] cost me $108. I'm sure there is some obtuse
economic explanation involving economies of scale and the like, but it seems
fairly counter intuitive that a book that is over 900 pages long is cheaper
than one with less than 300.

The cost of books in general, and academic texts in particular, is (in my
opinion) revolting.
