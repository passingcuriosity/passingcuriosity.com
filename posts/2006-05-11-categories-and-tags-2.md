title: Categories and Tags
---

As on <a href="http://interestingexperience.blogspot.com/">my other
blog</a>, I've added support for tags and categories to TR[W[WL]]OACSS
using Del.icio.us. Readers with a browser that supports JavaScript
should see a list of categories at the top of the sidebar.

It's not terribly useful yet (in particular, the tag and category links
lead to the whole Del.icio.us tag, not just those items that are posts
on this blog), but we'll see how it goes.
