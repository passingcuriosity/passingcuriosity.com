  2009.

I'm looking forward to attending [Edge of the Web 2009][1]. [The
programme](http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/program/) looks pretty
interesting, though some of the abstracts are a teensy bit vague. 

I'm currently planning to attend the keynote presentations:

* [Anil Dash --  Next Year's Web][9]
* [Alex Payne -- The Importance of Language: How The Technologies We
  Use Shape the Web][8]; and 
* [Derek Powazek -- Wisdom of Community][7]. And the panel thingo.

And I've decided on the following sessions:

* [Lachlan Hardy -- Building Better, Cheaper Sites on the Open Web][2]
* [Dmitry Baranovskiy -- Writing Better JavaScript Libraries][3]
* [Kevin Yank -- CSS Frameworks: Make the Right Choice][4]
* [Darcy Laycock & Matt Didcoe -- Making your website aware/geoaware][5]
* [Justin Mclean -- A practical guide to connecting hardware to the web][6]

That leaves only the Wednesday afternoon session to decided. I'm not much for lawyers or the law, so I'm going to have to choose between:

* [Nick Cowie -- Progressive Enhancement with CSS: Or how I stopped worrying about IE6 and started loving CSS3][10]; and
* [Myles Eftos -- Stuff They Never Taught You at Website School][11].

On Friday I'm going to two of the [workshops](http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/workshops/):

* Twitter Platform In-Depth -- Alex Payne; and
* JavaScript: beyond the DOM and AJAX -- Dmitry Baranovskiy.

In addition to the conference, I'm going to a few of the [fringe
events](http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/fringe-events/):

* the [inaugural UX Bookclub](http://forums.port80.asn.au/showthread.php?t=13483)
* the [Perth Port80](http://www.port80.asn.au/)
* [Webjam 11](http://webjam.com.au/webjam11)

A busy week.
