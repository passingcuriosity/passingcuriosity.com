I've just read issue two of [*Death, Jr.*][1] and it is even better than the first.
Ted Naihef's art is brilliant; the contrast between Death (Jr.'s dad) and the
rest of their suburban existence if wonderful.

Run out and grab a copy now, you [probably] won't be disappointed.

Edit: Issue #2 got a fairly [bad review][2] at Comics Should Be Good. I agree
with everything said there, but I still liked it.]
