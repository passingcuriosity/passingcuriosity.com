The [Japanese Film Festival][0] run by the Japan Foundation, Sydney
has been running since 1997. At the 2016 festival I spent a weekend
watching five films:

- [Kampai! For the Love of Sake (カンパイ! 世界が恋する日本酒)][1]
- [SIX FOUR: Part 1 (64 ロクヨン 前編)][2]
- [SIX FOUR: Part 2 (64 ロクヨン 後編)][3]
- [What a Wonderful Family! (家族はつらいよ)][5]
- [The Mohican Comes Home (モヒカン故郷に帰る)][4]

Not long after I also watched:

- [Your Name (君の名は)][7]

*Kampai!* is a documentary about three people who are involved in
the [sake][6] industry: John Gauntner -- a Western sake expert, Philip
Harper -- a British-born sake brewer working in Japanese breweries,
and Kosuke Kuji -- a 5th generation sake brewery owner. If you are
interested in sake, booze, or documentaries, I suggest watching it if
you get the chance.

Based on a best selling novel *SIX FOUR* is a single massive story
divided into two feature length films. I saw part one on the flight
back from Japan after ICFP and was super excited to see them both at
the film festival. The story follows a large cast of characters
involved in the unsolved kidnapping, ransom, and murder of a little
girl. It was the only major case in the year Shōwa 64 (which only
lasted a week), hence the name. It spends a lot of time on the
interaction between the police and the press and on politics within
and between the prefectural and national police agencies but the
personal dramas of the central police officer and the murdered girl's
father. Highly recommended!

*What a Wonderful Family* kicks off when Tomiko's birthday request of
Shuzo -- her husband of 50 years -- assent to the divorce papers she's
had prepared. The resulting family drama was, if I recall correctly,
mostly played for laughs. Not too serious but fun nonetheless.

*The Mohican Comes Home* is something of a "fish out of water"
film. It follows a Eikichi and Yuka -- a metal musician and his big
city girlfriend -- as they visit the small island village he grew up
in. The film was funny and poignant by turns and I quite enjoyed it
but don't go out of your way to track it down.

At about the same time the Japanese Film Festival was in Sydney the
super excellent anime film [Your Name (君の名は)][7] had a fairly wide
Australian cinema release (capital cities and some other centres) and
I went to see that too. It's begins with the two teenage main
characters -- a girl who lives in a small town and a boy from Tokyo --
waking up having swapped bodies (which they continue to do on a semi
regular basis). Eventually it becomes clear that her life is a few
years in the past relative to his and that her small town was (will
be) destroyed by a meteorite killing most of the residents! I loved
this film a lot! I've been listening to the soundtrack on pretty heavy
rotation and am really hanging out for the DVD release. If you don't
hate anime, see it!
