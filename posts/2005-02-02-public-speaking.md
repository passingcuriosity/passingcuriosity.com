I used to hate public speaking, now I just dislike it. I've had to give presentations on a number of occasions and, normally, my mind goes blank, I forget to so much as look at my notes and I manage to muddle through whatever I was supposed to say without screwing up too badly, but without the level of technical detail I should be able to impart.



This morning (11:00AM Canberra time) I gave my presentation about my summer research project and, as a result I can't help but feel I'm gradually getting over my hatred of public speaking. This is probably a good thing as I expect to have to give a number of presentations this year during Honours.
