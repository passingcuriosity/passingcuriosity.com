I saw a comic shop whilst in town today, and decided to pop in for a look.  I
left having spent nearly $60 on the Seikei Trilogy. I've written a little about
it in the two posts above from my reading blog: [The Seikai Trilogy][1] and
[More on the Seikai Trilogy][2] (NB: these posts are now located here on
Passing Curiosity).
