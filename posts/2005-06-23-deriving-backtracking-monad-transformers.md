title: Deriving Backtracking Monad Transformers
---
I started reading <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=351258">Deriving Backtracking Monad Transformers</a>, by Ralf Hinze, this afternoon (or, rather, yesterday afternoon). It's <a href="http://labelledtableaux.blogspot.com/2005/06/polymorphism-and-generality-redux-or.html">already</a> been valuable, though that was more of a side effect.

I've haven't read too much of it yet, but I've been able to understand what I have read, which means either<ul><li>I'm learning; or</li><li>Hinze is a good writer; or</li><li>deriving backtracking monad transformers is simple.</li></ul>I hope that it's due to an increase in my understanding, but either of the other two cases might be true as well.

Next on the list is <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/comment/reply/789"> Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers</a> by Oleg Kiselyov, Chung-chieh Shan, Daniel P. Friedman and Amr Sabry.
