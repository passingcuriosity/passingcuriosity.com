This post is my notes on Anil Dash's keynote speech on "Next Year's Web." It's
a bit messy, but most of it is here.

Presumptuous to say what it'll look like. Instead give us a framework
to decide what it will look like next year. We have the extraordinary
capability to create the web (democratization, etc.).

# Community of Creators

Photo of people at SXSW. Just "writing on the web" was enough of a
reason to get together. Turns out they were from w/ Gawker, Twitter,
Flickr, Metafilter, etc., etc.

First, 100 blogs. You could read them all, every day. Now 100,000,000.

# This Year's Web

Companies that shape the web currently. Much of the reporting and news
characterise them as competitors "jousting" in an arena.

* **Google** -- search engine, then money machine, the third act is a bit
  strange (PageFlip. WTF?) (SF and the Valley is a myth) But Google
  Wave (bit like a segway: "cool tech but I don't want to ride it"
  "bit like a segway for email") Sincere about DBE (in the way only
  Californians can be), but many/most of their options are evil.

* **Microsoft** -- interesting. (Google now = MS at Windows 95) Parallels
  about new OS (W95, ChromeOS), new browser (IE6, Chrome). "People
  have hated us for a long time now." ZuneHD, Bing, etc. are
  interesting, not ugly. "Wouldn't be shocked if Azure is the best
  plaform for hosting PHP next year."

* **Yahoo!** -- feel bad for them. Used to be cool ("most of you are old
  enough"). Biggest, most frequented site/s on the web. Still a
  fundamentally insecure organisation. But we won't use it unless we
  think that the whole thing is sustainable. Like a childrens story:
  "Just believe in yourself." Myth: "Google is machines, we're
  people."

* **Amazon** -- Both Kindle and the books (for Kindle, phone, laptop,
  etc.) both make money. Revolutionary! (Cf Google paying for Android
  to be used (they'll do searches and make G money)). They've built an
  enormous infrastructure for their retail systems, selling it as AWS
  (funding each other, etc.)

* **Twitter** -- interesting to see how quickly they've become a player.
  But scary amount of power. @anildash as a recommended followee, got
  700 in minutes. Not [just] a product, company, etc Platform,
  pervasive, blah, blah. Huge amount of money from funding: lots of
  resources, but similarly huge obligations. Recommended list is great
  idea for 100K users, but problematic for 100M users. Huge number of
  apps. Experimentations, simplicity, path of least resistance.

* **Facebook** -- shocked to find even more popular in .au than .us.
  Explicitly designed as a private enclave for Ivy League students.
  Design and platform in service of Facebook's goals. Not enough
  criticism (esp. given that foreign, not contact/understanding w/ our
  values, etc.) "It's complicated" relationships in other cultures
  might be offensive.

* **AOL** -- there are a *lot* of lessons. Was 1/3 of users' access to
  the web. They were the biggest platform. Proprietary language
  (Rainman?) for applications inline with the AOL interface. Were
  thousands of people working using this. Now days we'd call it an
  AppStore. The iPhone of the 90's. "GAOL". Could only email each
  other, but RFC email won (and we get newsletters, lists, marketting,
  etc.)

In the same way ice cubes are made of water (but still float on top of
it), these companies are "made of web". 

When we're asked "what's the biggest platform/social network?" we
shouldn't be thinking of the traditional pie chart of market share.
The answer, of course, is the whole pie: it's the whole web.

# The biggest social network is the web itself!

We can look at the big mainstream media sites and see the pattern
that's going to happen on the web. Expect the decentralisation in
online media that has happened in TV/Cable/Papers/etc.

Users are adopting a new network a year -- the same rate as new email
addresses -- but the old ones don't go away. We can anticipate that
they're going to form a long tail. Our sites, along with all the
others, will have profiles, etc. and will be part of this curve. The
"mainstream" networks will just be the top of the curve.

The current "refresh Twitter" cycle is the same pattern of centralised
information distribution that we've been decrying in newspapers, etc.

YouTube are the richest company in the history of the universe, and
they *could* solve any problem they want to. But the YouTube comments
are still a cesspool.

So too are the comments on newspaper sites.

The people who make happy cat pictures can build good, supportive, fun
communities, but the big companies, newspapers, etc. fail.

# Culture Drives Adoption #

Rather listen to a Spears song, than a technologist talk about music.
(They're nerds and have terrible taste.)

Encourage people to be **Creators of Culture**

Marsupials. He got to eat two of them!

Pangea, breaking up. Building a large number of niches.

We've been abdicating the control of our niche to people outside it. 

In niche communities, power shifts to creators.


Ask Metafilter vs Yahoo! Answers. Y!A is the single most depressing
site on the web.


# Next Year's Web #

"Pustbutton" -- deliver realtime updates from your site to anyone else
on the web. PubSubPubHub, RSS cloud, etc. Relaying information through
generic infrastructure. Very low costs.

A *feature* not a company.

Examples: **OpenID** (he was in the room when it was invented!) I am
in control of my identity. One open network for authentication,
authorisation, identity. Imagine the possibilities of combining this
with the real-time messaging -- a message from me (fo' reals), in
real-time, with whatever payload we need!

* The web is the social network
* Think about the big sites as the main stream media
* Culture, not features, drives adoption
* Learn from successes like OpenID, RSS cloud PSBH, etc.
* Relies on communities of creators

# Questions

**What about Apple? They seem to be doing it well.**

Secrecy doesn't scale. Spend months writing an app, send it into the
black hole of the approval process.

FCC & Google Voice. Apple responded in three days.

Gruber is just a guy, but when he asks questions, the secrecy starts
to come down.

The whole circus of WWDC and keynotes proves the "culture drives
adoption."

**Businesses choose to live in the close region for a more pleasant
experience early on. Kindle is DRM-ridden, but they've bought Stanza
to hedge their bets. What are your thoughts?**

Cyclical: closed and pretty, to ugly and open, ad infinitum.

Fighting Google News, Napster, etc. It happens repeatedly, everywhere
we have technology.

Mentioned Everyblock. Aggreates data locally. Funded by a non-profit
to promote local journalism, uses public data. Sold to Microsoft for
$5M.

We may see free and open technologies reaching parity with closed
competitors on similar time scales (with the pushbutton technologies).
We may wind up without being screwed.

**Homogenisation viz EC2, etc.**

Can we differentiate if we're all on the same stack and platform. But
it seemed to work OK when everything was LAMP. The lower levels become
commoditised.

An appstore for servers. Push a button and get a new server. Use one
on Azure, one on EC2, etc. and have them work together as suited.
