[The Code Book][1] by [Simon Singh][2]

A week or two ago, I finished reading Simon Singh's second book: *The Code
Book* and it is every bit as good as *Fermat's Last Theorem* was. Simon Singh
is, in my opinion and experience, one of the best popular science writers
around (though I still need to get a copy of *A Brief History of Time*). I'd
write more on the book but anything I could say, has already been said.
