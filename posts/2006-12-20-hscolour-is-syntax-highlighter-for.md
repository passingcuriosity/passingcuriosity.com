title: A patch adding latex support to HsColour
---

<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/darcs/hscolour">HsColour</a> is a syntax highlighter for <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> that can generate output in a number of formats including, if the patch I just submitted is accepted, <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. To get LaTeX output from HsColour:

`darcs pull http://darcs.thomas-sutton.id.au/hscolour/`

Or wait for it to show up in the main-line.
