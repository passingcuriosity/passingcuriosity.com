title: Three new philosophy books
tags: books, logic, philosophy
---

I've just bought three new philosophy books: [Logic][1] by [Greg Restall][1-1]
[Conspicuous Consumption][2] by [Thorstein Veblen][2-0], and [On The Public][3]
by [Alastair Hannay][3-0].

I happened to spot [Logic: An Introduction][1] on the shelf and needed to buy
it. Hence, now that I've got a bit of money to spare, I have bought it. I
expect it will be brilliant.

I've already read one volume from Routledge's *Thinking In Action* series and,
[as][2-1] [previously][2-2] [noted][2-3] I really liked it. Hopefully [On The
Public][2] will be just as good.

I've liked some of the other books in Penguin's *Great Ideas* series, so I hope
that [Conspicuous Consumption][3] will be just as interesting.
