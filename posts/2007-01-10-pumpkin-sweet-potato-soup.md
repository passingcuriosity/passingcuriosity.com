title: Pumpkin and sweet potato soup
tags: cooking, recipe
---

I made a soup based on the [Spiced Pumpkin Soup][1] and [Pumpkin Soup][2]
recipes from the [Wikibooks Cookbook][3] to use up half a pumpkin and a sweet
potato.  I made a few concessions to expediency (I only had dried onion, didn't
have any garlic, etc.), but it turned out fairly well.
