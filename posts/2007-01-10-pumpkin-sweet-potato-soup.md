I made a soup based on the [Spiced Pumpkin Soup][1] and [Pumpkin Soup][2]
recipes from the [Wikibooks Cookbook][3] to use up half a pumpkin and a sweet
potato.  I made a few concessions to expediency (I only had dried onion, didn't
have any garlic, etc.), but it turned out fairly well.

# Ingredients #

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons dried diced onion
- 3 tablespoons plain flour
- 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
- 1/4 of a pumpkin, peeled and cubed
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 litre vegetable stock
- 1 cup whole milk


# Method #

1. Melt the butter in a large saucepan and add the onion, flour, and spices.
   Sauté for a few minutes.

2. Add stock, salt and vegetables. Boil until the vegetables are cooked.

3. If possible and desired, blend in a food processor until smooth (allow to
   cool for 10-20 minutes first).

4. Bring back to boil (if you blended it) and add the milk. Simmer for 5-10
   minutes.
