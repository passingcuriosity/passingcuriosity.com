After a meeting with my supervisor, I've decided that this week is the last straw - if I can't manage to get a handle on my pile of assignments this week, then I obviously don't want to be here right now. I had a bit of a go at some of it last night and seemed to get on all right.

If I can finish my report on neural networks by tonight, read the Google papers (the original paper and that on map-reduce) and get a good way through the first algorithms assignment tomorrow, I think I'll get there.
