excerpt:
  I recently attended a tasting of koshu - aged sake - at Sake Shop in
  Sydney. Here are some thoughts about the experience.
---

Most sake is sold and drunk very soon after it is produced but some, *koshu*, is aged. At this event Leigh Hudson from [Sake Shop][0] presented four koshu (and a mirin) from two producers. The five drinks (shown below from right to left) were:

![The lineup, right to left][1]\ 

1. [Senbazuru aged daiginjo][2] $188.00
2. [Daruma Masamune 3 year old][3] $69.95
3. [Daruma Masamune 5 year old][4] $118.95
4. [Daruma Masamune 10 year old][5] $189.95
5. [Fukuraijun ume mirin][6] $48.95

*Senbazuru aged daiginjo*

> A light koshu made from daiginjo aged for 10 years. Pale yellow and thin. Sweet melon, juicy pear, and nashi aromas are quite pronounced. A little drier than I expected given the nose. The melon notes are present in the palate. Long finish with hints of honeydew melon.
>
> As it warmed the melon aromas became more prominent, the mouthfeel thicker, and the finish longer. The palate had more ripe orchard fruits.

*Daruma Masamune 3 year old koshu*

> Golden yellow, honey colour. Quite viscous. Honey and ripe apricot notes on first taste. Then savoury notes appear: dried ham and mushroom.

*Daruma Masamune 5 year old koshu*

> Thick, clinging liquid with a rich honey colour.
>
> Richer, more complex nose than the 3 year old with more savoury notes: rich dripping gravy or vegemite. But in the mouth I get notes of dark chocolate and coffee beans! Some acid notes and hints of smoke hiding in the back. Like eating chocolate coated coffee beans.
>
> This is totally unlike the 3 year old and is, by far, my favourite of the drinks today.

*Daruma Masamune 10 year old koshu*

> Very dark, brown mahogany colour. Develops the themes from the 5 year old: chocolate and coffee, touch of caramel sweetness. Like a fruity specialty coffee.

*Fukuraijun ume mirin*

> Tastes like ume. Doesn't have the somewhat cloying sweetness I find in some umeshu. Nice, but not something I'd seek out.

I can't see myself buying anything like the aged daiginjo -- it was so similar to an unaged daiginjo that I can't see past the extra $100+ -- or the ume mirin, but I'll definitely be looking for more like the Daruma Masamune koshu. It can keep company with the bottle of the 5 year old that I bought!
