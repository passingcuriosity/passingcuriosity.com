I've just had to take my iBook in to <a
href="http://www.themacshop.com.au/">The Mac Shop</a> to get its charger (or
perhaps the power regulation circuitry) fixed as it no longer wants to charge.

Unfortunately, this means that I'm unable to do any work for the next few days
and may not get as much as I'd like done before my return to Canberra.
