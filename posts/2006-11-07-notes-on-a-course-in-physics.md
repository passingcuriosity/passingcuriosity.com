title: Notes on a Course in Physics
---
<p>Over the course of the next six weeks, I will be taking an enabling course in physics. Designed to prepare people without a formal education in physics to study it at an undergraduate level, the course aims to cover enough of a high-school physics syllabus to meet university entry requirements in approximately six weeks.</p>

<p>On this blog, I will post notes, links, and other materials that may be of use to others who wish to begin studying physics.</p>
