title: Summary of 2018
---

# Studying

I attended the AMIS Summer School in Melbourne.

I dropped out, again, from my ordinary differential equations course. This
is the road block that is keeping my from completing my maths degree.

# Online

I deleted most of my social media accounts.

# Drinking

I did the WSET level 1 and level 2 courses in *sake*.

I drank a lot of *sake* and a lot of whisky, and I visited three distilleries
(Starward, Hellyers Road, and Launceston)

I attended a lot of events.

# Computering

I worked in a few enterprise environments, some of them worse than anywhere
I'd worked before, but some of them much better.

I worked with a number of new-to-me technologies in anger for the first time:
Kafka, Kerberos, Kubernetes.

I wrote Java for the first time since 2005.
