title: Grice and Implication in Conversation
---
There was a meeting of <a href="http://rsise.anu.edu.au/~jon/NotYASS">NotYASS</a> (Not Yet Another Seminar Series) tonight, this time with the topic of: 'Implicature and conversational meaning. Christian Rau began by talking a bit about communication in general before explaining the basics of Grice's account of communication (his maxims).

It led to an interesting discussion covering a range of topics, from the utility of the maxims, the difference between maxims and axioms, a rather large number of examples, various conditional operators (material, strict, Lewis/Stalnacker and intuitionistic) and the implications of/for AI.

A very interesting discussion.
