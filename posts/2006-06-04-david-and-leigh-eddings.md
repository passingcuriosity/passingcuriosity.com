I've just begun rereading that masterpiece of epic fantasy, David and Leigh
Eddings' series: [The Belgariad][1]. I was given [The Pawn of Prophecy][2] as a
gift one birthday and it became my "gateway drug" to the realm of fantasy. I've
since read it so many times that it has quite literally fallen to pieces
(annoyingly as that cover is no longer in print).  Even after these ten or so
years and probably near three or four times that many readings, it is still
able to capture me more completely than nearly any other book I've read.

If you haven't read the Eddings' work yet, you don't know what you're missing.
Get thee to a bookshop and grab The Pawn of Prophecy or [The Diamond Throne][3]
(book one in the Eddings' other great pair of series: [The Elenium][4] and [The
Tamuli][5]).
