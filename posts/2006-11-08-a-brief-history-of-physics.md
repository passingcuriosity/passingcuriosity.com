Aristotle was perhaps the first in the Western tradition to look at mechanics
in any sort of structured way. A philosopher, rather than physicist, Aristotle
thought about the way objects interact with each other, particularly their
motions.

One of the ideas to come from Aristotle's work is that objects "like" to remain
at rest. This seems rather reasonable -- put a book on a table and it remains
still, push it gently and it will move until you stop. This begs the question,
though -- what happens when we throw ad object? Our hand stops pushing, but the
object continues to move. Likewise when we roll a ball -- we release the ball
and it continues to move. Aristotle's answer was impetus.

When an object is moved by another (your hand, for example, throwing a ball),
it accrues impetus. When the mover stops acting upon the movee, the impetus it
accrued whilst being acted upon is used to continue the motion. Under this
model, we would expect objects to exhibit straight-line trajectories (see <a
href="#hist-fig-1">figure one</a>) rather than the parabolic trajectories (see
<a href="#hist-fig-2">figure two</a>) we see when we throw an object.

<p><a name="hist-fig-2"><em>Figure 2:</em></a> A parabolic trajectory of the
sort predicted by classical mechanics.</p>

A second idea of Aristotle's is that heavier objects fall faster than lighter
objects. It does, at first glance, seem rather reasonable but it is, like the
idea of impetus, quite easily shown incorrect.

The Aristotleans didn't bother to take observations or do experiments to
support their beliefs and most of those that came after them were content to
trust Aristotle. Thus for more than 100 years, our understanding of mechanics
was fundamentally flawed. It is the resolution of this flaw that brings the
next major milestone in mechanics: experimentation.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Galileo Galilei and other became amongst
the first physicists when they used experimentation to confirm and reject their
ideas about the motion of objects. Among Galileo's more famous experiments
(though the story is now considered to be untrue) is his dropping balls of
varing mass of the Leaning Tower of Pisa by which he showed that, contrary to
Aristotle's account, the speed of a falling object is independant of its mass.
It is precisely this power -- to overturn wrong ideas, even if though they have
been believed true for centuries, and to suggest a more complete understanding
-- that makes experimentation so central to all of the sciences.

This experimental focus was not the last development in the physics that we'll
be looking at, though it did help pave the way for it. This next and final (for
our purposes) leap was due to Newton -- using mathematics to describe physics.
After that, classical mechanics was essentially complete, with "only" quite a
few decades of improvements and polishing before the introduction of relativity
and quantum mechanics. It is physics at this level, the state of the art of
classical mechanics circa the mid 19th century, that we'll be studying in this
course.
