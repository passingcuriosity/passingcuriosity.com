I watched 9 films on the Japanese Film Festival 2019 programme: 

- *Masquerade Hotel*
- *Saint Young Men 2nd Century*
- *And Your Bird Can Sing*
- *Born Bone Born*
- *Dance With Me*
- *My Dad is a Heel Wrestler*
- *Noise*
- *Samurai Shifters*
- *JK Rock*

I saw *Masquerade Hotel* on a flight earlier in the year. It's a fun mystery
with detectives going under cover as staff at a high-end Tokyo hotel. 

*Saint Young Men* is a collection of episodic sketches following Jesus and
Buddha as they share a flat in Tokyo. I found it funny but quite short.

*And Your Bird Can Sing* follows three friends during a summer. It's a drama
largely driven by characters and ended with lots of unresolved drama.

*Born Bone Born* sees a family gathering on the fourth anniversary of their wife
and mother's death to was her bones in an Okinawan funerary ritual. This was
another character driven film but it was marred, I think, by the frequent
intrusion of comic interludes into otherwise dramatic scenes.

*Dance With Me* is a musical road-trip comedy following a corporate worker as she
tries to break the spell (or curse!) of a botched hypnotism which forces her to
sing and dance whenever she hears music. 

*My Dad is a Heel Wrestler* follows a young boy as he discovers and deals with
the fact that his dad works as Cockroach Mask, a heel wrestler.

*Noise* was another character driven drama following the lives of several people
impacted by the Akihabara massacre. Like *And Your Bird Can Sing*, there's not a
great deal of resolution to be found here.

*Samurai Shifters* is a period piece that follows a samurai clan forced to
relocate. I thought it was funny in places and pretty well paced but some
elements could have done with a little more time to develop fully -- I suspect
it was trimmed a little too much in editing.

*JK Rock* follows three high-school girls as they form a rock group. One thing I
found a little odd was the ridiculous car (surely product placement?) and the
pastel interior design of the "rock cafe". Interestingly, the actresses playing
the band members did, indeed, form a rock group: [Drop Doll][2].
