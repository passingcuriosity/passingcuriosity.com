I've just finished watching a wonderful anime series: <a href="http://www.somedaysdreamers.com/">Someday's Dreamers</a>. The characters are engaging, especially <a href="http://www.somedaysdreamers.com/yume.htm">Yume</a> and <a href="http://www.somedaysdreamers.com/angela.htm">Angela</a>, and the way that the apparently unrelated incidents come together to drive the last few episodes is very well done. The production values were obviously very high, with good voice acting (the Japanese, I didn't bother listening to the American), good art and animation and a gorgeous soundtrack.<br /><br />The only thing that disappointed me was Inoue being the object of Angela's desire when I was expecting it to be Yume. Oh well, you can't have everything.<br /><br />A very nice show. Everyone should give it a try.
