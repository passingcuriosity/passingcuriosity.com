<a class="title" href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/publications/prints/2005/siek05:_fg_pldi.pdf">Essential Language Support for Generic Programming</a> by Jeremy Siek and Andrew Lumsdaine.

This paper presents an extension of <acronym>System F</acronym> called <acronym>System F<sup>G</sup></acronym>. The motivation for the work is in the construction of generic algorithms and, more importantly, the verification of their use. It looks to me as though the authors have taken a little bit too much of <acronym>C++</acronym> on board.

The concepts of the paper are very similar to Haskell's type classes (according to section two, the main difference is that type classes are designed to allow Hindley-Milner type inference) and the associated types seem to me to be filling a similar role as functional dependancies. I found it rather interesting and it's the first type system paper I've read since I achieved a vague understanding of type systems.
