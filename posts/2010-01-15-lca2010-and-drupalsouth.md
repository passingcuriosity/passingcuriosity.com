I'm currently in Wellington, New Zealand for [linux.conf.au 2010][lca2010] and
then [DrupalSouth][drupalsouth]. It's going to be a pretty awesome week! I'm
looking forward to getting back up to speed with Linux which I've used only
superficially for the last few years after switching, on a lark, to FreeBSD
and then to Mac OS X.

I'm looking forward to seeing just how much Linux has changed since I last
built my own kernel (circa 2003).

I'll be going to the [Open programming languages][oplm], [Multicore and
Parallel Computing][par], [Data Storage & Retrieval][osda], and [System
Administration][sysadm] miniconfs. Session wise, I intend to look in on most
of the kernel and low-level user space talks that I can.

After LCA per se is done (but during open day, unfortunately) I'll be at
DrupalSouth to pick up some more Drupal-fu by osmosis.

If you're interested, you can see more LCA and Drupal specific articles in the
[LCA archive][lca] and [Drupal archive][drupal].
