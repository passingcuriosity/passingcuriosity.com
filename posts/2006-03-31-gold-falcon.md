I saw a little display in <a href="http://birchalls.com.au/">Birchall's</a>
today advertising the imminent release of Katherine Kerr's latest book *Gold
Falcon* <a href="http://www.deverry.com/goldexcp.html">(excerpt)</a>. This is
very, very good news -- if they're sending posters out to bookshops, then it's
all but certain to actually ship!
