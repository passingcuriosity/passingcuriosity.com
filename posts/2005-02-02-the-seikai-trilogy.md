I made the mistake of going into [Impact Comics][4] on the way back to school
today, and came out the owner of all three volumes of the Seikai Trilogy manga
released in English by Tokyopop: [Crest of the Stars][1], [Banner of the
Stars][2], and [Banner of the Stars II][3].

What I've seen of the anime (*Crest of the Stars*, *Banner of the Stars* and
some of *Banner of the Stars II*) based on the original novels is brilliant. It
is fascinating watching the characters and their relationships grow and develop
over the course of however many years.

Whilst in the shop, I noticed that they have most of Lone and Cub (forgive the
lack of a link, but I can't find the [Dark Horse][5] site for the series
anymore), which I'll have to finish off as I bought the first 19 volumes whilst
I was in England a few years ago.

They also have a lot of stuff that just looks interesting. I can feel my fluid
fiscal state evaporating as I think about it.
