<a class="title" href="">Jingle Bells: Solving the Santa Claus Problem in Polyphonic C#</a> by Nick Benton.

This paper presents the solution to the Santa Claus problem in the <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/polyphony/">Polyphonic C#</a>
language. Polyphonic C# is an extension of Microsoft's C# language with
concurrency primitives based on those of the <a
href="http://moscova.inria.fr/index.shtml">join calculus</a>. It was intended
for use in "orchestrating distributed applications built on asynchronous
messaging," but is "equally applicable to programming with multiple threads in
a shared-memory environment."

This is, the authors claim, another piece of evidence supporting the claim that
the join calculus is an effective basis for concurrent, as well as distributed,
programming.
