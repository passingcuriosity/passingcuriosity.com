I'm about half-way through reading <a
href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> and, while it hasn't
changed my opinion of economics, it has impressed upon me the flexibility of
modern statistics. If you're dubious about the status of economics as a science
in its own right, I don't think that this book will convince you one way or the
other (it hasn't changed my opinion), but it is a fascinating, well written
book.
