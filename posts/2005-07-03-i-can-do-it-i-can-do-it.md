title: I can do it, I can do it...

The system is nearly to the stage where I can write the propositional logic in it. I've been held up by a bit of trouble writing the code to generate a formula parser from the definitions of the logical operators. Once that is written, I need to modify it slightly (to generate a parser, rather than generate code to generate a parser) to parse the rule patterns, and logic compiler will be finished.

Then it'll need a Makefile (or something similar) to link a logic with the tableau engine (the simple, unlabelled version of it is finished), and we'll be finished with this initial stage of development.
