excerpt: 
  The April 2013 meeting of the FP-Syd group had presentations about GPU
  programming with Accelerate and little languages using the Free data
  structure.

Trevor McDonell gave a presentation about **the [Accelerate][] Haskell
library**, which provides an EDSL for writing code which is compiled and
executed on the GPU.

The approach involves using an EDSL to write CUDA code in a Haskell program.
This is generates code to be compiled and shipped to the GPU at run time.
Being Haskell, there's a bunch of nice types involved: matrices have shapes,
matrix and scalar programs/fragments are of different types, and there are a
few of typeclasses.

Trevor demonstrated a [brute-force MD5 collision finder][hashcat] written with
Accelerate which was very impressive.

Mark Hibberd spoke about **interpreters and little languages with the [Free][]
package**. Essentially, this boiled down to using Free with its functor and
monad instances to replace an API full of `IO a` typed operations, each of
them possibly unsafe, with a nice monadic EDSL and a single `IO` interpreter
function.

The various operations in the API no longer "do" the operation but build up a
data structure describing the operations to be performed as a little data
structure (essentially an AST) which the client code passes to an evaluation
function.

The more advanced theory categories and groups and left adjoint functors and
such left me behind, but his running example of a password manager library (to
generate, store and retrieve passwords) very illuminated the practical side of
using this technique. I'm quite looking forward to Jed Wesley-Smith's YOW!
Lambda Jam talk about a similar topic: [Connection Management, FP Style: A
Case Study][talk].
