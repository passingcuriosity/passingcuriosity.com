I've just watched the <a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/english/2508.htm">semi-finals</a> of the <a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/english/index.htm">Eurovision Song Contest</a> for 2006 on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a>. The only comment that springs to mind is that it is a travesty that Poland's entry <a href="http://www.ichtroje.pl/">Ich Troje</a> didn't get a place in the finals.
