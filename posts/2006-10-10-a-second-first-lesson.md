Today I took my first CAD lesson as teacher. I'd intended for the
students to use this first lesson to being the self-paced tutorials for
<a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">SketchUp</a>, the program we'll be
using. Rather than *start* the tutorials, most of the class had them
*finished* half way through the lesson.

As a stop gap, I drew some simple figures on the board (just a few basic
roof, door and window shapes) for the ones who finished earlier than I
was expecting to complete and asked the students that finished even
those to model items from around the class room. The main thing that I
got out of this lesson is the need to have extension work planned and
ready to go &mdash; making up extension problems one at a time doesn't
work nearly so well when it's the whole class.

Feed back from my colleague teachers includes the need for me work on
getting and maintaining the students' attention (e.g. when giving
instruction) as I have a tendency to try to talk over the top of them
which doesn't work very well as a) I'm not loud enough, and b) they
aren't listening. I also need to make sure that I keep them on task.
