I've just got back from Tasmania (visiting my family and friends). With me,
I've bought the rest of my comics collection. The first 18 volumes of *Lone
Wolf and Cub* have certainly helped fill up my book case. When you throw in the
rest of my books (novels, texts, references and popular sciences) and my CD and
DVD collection, I need more shelf space. The only problem is that there is
nowhere to put a book case. I suppose I'll just have to make do.

Returning to comics, I've just added 6 books to my list of things to order,
which is both good ("New comics. Yay!") and bad ("Where did that $100 go?!?").
Most of them are books by Andi Watson . Looks like I'll soon have all of
Watson's releases, or at least the trade paperbacks of them.

On the books front, *CTM* (or more completely: *Concepts, Techniques and Models
of Computer Programming* by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi) has come in.  I'm
going to pick it up tomorrow, but it'll be a while before I can start reading
it (what with the million and one things I have to do in the next week or so).
