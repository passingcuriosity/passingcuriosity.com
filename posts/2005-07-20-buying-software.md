I just bought a copy of <a href="http://www.pacific.adobe.com/products/photoshopelmac/main.html?c=au">Photoshop Elements 3.0</a>. As I've got a digital camera now, I thought that I'd better get something in which to <emph>edit</emph> the photographs I sure to take. It's been a very long time since I last used (perhaps "fumbled with" might be more accurate) Photoshop and I'm looking forward to learning it.<br /><br />On the other hand, if the application itself is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/327575.html">as dodgy as the installer</a>, then this could be a painful experience.
