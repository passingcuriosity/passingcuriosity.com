title: About Labelled Tableaux
---
On this blog I will chronicle the work on my Honours project in computer science: developing a system to construct counter-models for non-theorems of modal logics. This system will be a small theorem prover based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_tableaux">tableaux</a>, written in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.

I will link to relevant papers and technical reports, technical details which I encounter whilst coding, material that I make available to download, and anything else in the slightest bit relevant to the topic at hand.
