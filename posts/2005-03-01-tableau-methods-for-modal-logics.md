I've been reading Rajeev Gore's chapter on tableau methods for modal logics
for the last few days. I think I'm starting to understand the unlabelled
tableau systems now, though I still don't see why one would want to use an
unlabelled tableau calculus over a labelled one, especially for mechanisation.
This new-found semi-understanding makes me think that I'm going to have to
re-read the Matsumoto and Mouri papers I looked at last week.

I've still not encountered anything about counter-model extraction in Gor√©
yet, perhaps it was only meant to introduce me to the basics. I'm not yet
sure, but since I've started reading these papers, I've developed a bit of a
sinking feeling: perhaps counter-model extraction won't be as challenging as
we expect. I'd really rather not have implementation issues of the user
interface aspect dominating my thesis, if at all possible. Perhaps I'll be
able to take a detour through one of the more unusual logics to demonstrate
the counter-model extraction...

What ever happens, I've got a lot of work (and reading) ahead of me. I won't
know if it'll all be worth it until I get my first class [finger crossed]
Honours at the end of the year, but here's hoping.
