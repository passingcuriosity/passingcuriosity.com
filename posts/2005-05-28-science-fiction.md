A while back, I bought a novel on impulse (it was cheap). To my surprise (and
delight) it turned out to be the first space opera I've bought that was
actually good. If you're looking for an interesting story, with an intriguing
cast of characters, then I'd highly recommend [Trading in Danger][1] by
Elizabeth Moon.

Another recent find (this time of the on-line variety) is a science fiction
story called "The Outers" by "The Angst Guy". Though it is a piece of fan
fiction (based on the only good thing MTV has brought to the world [Daria][2]),
[The Outers][3] is an enthralling read. Perhaps its only fault is that it The
Angst Guy is not continuing it (or not currently, at least).
