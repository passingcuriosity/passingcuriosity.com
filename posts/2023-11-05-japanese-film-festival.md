excerpt:
  Short reviews of the films I saw at the 2023 Japanese Film Festival in
  Sydney.

Another [Japanese Film Festival][jff] has come and gone. The Sydney showings
were hosted by Palace Cinemas again this year. While I like Palace Cinemas,
having the programme spread over multiple locations made it a little
inconvenient to get all the films I wanted to see. In the end I went to six
films:

1. Yudo: The way of the bath
2. The lines that define me
3. We're broke, my lord
4. Brave: Gunjo Senki
5. Mondays: See you "this" week
6. Citizen Kitano

*Yudo (湯道)* A comedy focussed on two brothers and the [bath-house][] they
inherit after their father's death. It felt like the subplot around the older
brother's plans might have suffered in editing but the rest of the film hung
together well. I enjoyed it.

*The lines that define me (線は、僕を書く)* A drama following a university
student who is invited to become an apprentice of a famouse [sumi-e][]
painter and his relationships with the others in the group, his friends,
and his tragic history. I really enjoyed it.

*We're broke, my lord (大名倒産)* A period comedy set in the late Edo period.
A young man　who was raised by a salted salmon merchant discovers he's the
illegitimate son　of the [lord][] of the [estate][]. I thought it was very,
very trope-y, but good fun.

*Brave: Gunjo Senki* A high-school is transported back to the [warring states
period][]. Samurai attack the school, slaughter what seemed like most of the
students, and kidnap several hostages. Some of the [very few] survivors set out
to rescue their classmates before the school is carried back to the present
day. An uneven mix of high-school sports drama, samurai slasher film, and
isekai manga. Did not enjoy at all.

*Mondays: See you "this" week* A clever comedy with touches of The Office and
Groundhog Day. A well put together film, I really enjoyed it.

*Citizen Kitano* A film about [Takeshi Kitano][] and his work as a filmmaker
and artist. I'm not much of a film buff so this wasn't really my cup of tea but
it seemed well made and was interesting enough.

I didn't get to see as many films as in previous years and my miss-rate was
higher than previous years, but it was still a fun week of cinema. Thanks
[Japan Foundation][] and sponsors.
