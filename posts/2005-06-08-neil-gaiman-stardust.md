title: Neil Gaiman - Stardust

After fighting a losing battle against procrastination this morning, I went
into town and came back with a few more books to add to my collection
([Dymocks][2] are having a sale). Amongst them, was [Stardust][1] by Neil
Gaiman. After the slight disappointment of *The Gene of Isis* (which I plan to
finish next week), I've been pleased to note that Stardust is a quite pleasant
read. The first few dozen pages dragged me in whilst I was eating dinner and,
hence I have been unable to give the notes for Software Quality Management (the
exam I have tomorrow) one last read over.

The characters, what I've seen of them so far, are nice but the most enjoyable
aspect of the book (at this point in time) is the *language*. Gaiman's prose
simply flows off the page. This really, really needs to be an audio book, read
by someone like Stephen Fry.

Do yourself a favour and read Stardust.
