So my Apple iBook G4 is in the shop. Again. Getting repaired. Again. Having its
logic board replaced. Again.

I love the system -- OS X is, hands down, my favourite operating system  -- but
I don't think I'll be getting another Mac. I need a computer that will work,
not one that needs a major component replacing twice in two months. As soon as
I can afford to replace it, I think I'll get a PC laptop to run a Linux or BSD
and retire the Apple to desktop use or even as a household server.
