I love Lililicious. They have done translations of some great manga and Pieta
is, in my opinion, one of the best of those. If you are looking for a nice (if
a little angsty) shoujo-ai story, Pieta might be worth a download.

Download a scanlation from [Lililicious](http://www.lililicious.net/) or go
find it on [Amazon Japan](http://www.amazon.co.jp/).
