  I've been attending a lot of tastings, classes, etc. over the last

  to do.

The last few years I've been dabbling with whisky and sake: attending
tastings and events, buying bottles of drinks I don't really know much
about, running a whisky club at work, etc. I often take notes about
what I drink but they generally aren't worth bothering with.

Below I've listed most of the events I've been to and what I drank,
along with a note or two.

# 4th February

I visited Starward Distillery in Port Melbourne and took the
distillery tour. It ended with a tasting and I tried one or two others
at the bar before heading for the airport and home to Sydney. I really
like Starward: they make some great whisky and they make sure it's
available and affordable.

- Starward Solera

- Starward Wine Cask

- One of their pre-mixed cocktails, can't remember which.

- Starward 10th Anniversary Bottling

Their 10th Anniversary Bottling is very nice and I bought some to take
home.

Whisky appreciation at the Oak Barrel

- Slane

   > Nose sultanas, raisins, vanilla, Xmas cake
   >
   > Thick mouth feel, coated the mouth.
   >
   > A oak, spice, fruit.

- Glenrothes

   > Bigger nose, savoury umami egg seaside notes.
   >
   > Quite thick, coating.
   >
   > Flash of alcohol, lots of oak.
   >
   > With water less burn, more of the spices and sweetness to the
   > fore, long oak finish.

- Paul John

   > Massive blast on nose, nutty almond/walnut nose.
   >
   > Water makes nuttiness much more prominent. Brings out a syrup note

- Kilkerran

   > Much tamer nose. Some seaside hints.
   >
   > Light Highland peat.

- Overeem

   > Port with a sour note

- Kilchoman

   > Quite pale
   >
   > Ashtray nose first, then rained out bonfire.
   >
   > Very light mouthfeel.
   >
   > Smoke, spice, oak drawing out.
   >
   > Later the nose calms down: less ash and a touch of iodine.

- Stroma

   > Nose is interesting. Honey, floral, maybe a chilli
   >
   > Thick in glass and syrupy in mouth, really coats tongue.
