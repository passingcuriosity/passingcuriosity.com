  I've been attending a lot of tastings, classes, etc. over the last
  year or so. Getting some details down in writing seems like a thing
  to do.

The last few years I've been dabbling with whisky and sake: attending
tastings and events, buying bottles of drinks I don't really know much
about, running a whisky club at work, etc. I often take notes about
what I drink but they generally aren't worth bothering with.

Below I've listed most of the events I've been to and what I drank,
along with a note or two.

# 4th February

I visited [Starward Distillery][1] in Port Melbourne and took the
distillery tour. It ended with a tasting and I tried one or two others
at the bar before heading for the airport and home to Sydney. I really
like Starward: they make some great whisky and they make sure it's
available and affordable.

- Starward Solera

- Starward Wine Cask

- One of their pre-mixed cocktails, can't remember which.

- Starward 10th Anniversary Bottling

Their 10th Anniversary Bottling is very nice and I bought some to take
home.

# 15th February

Whisky appreciation at the Oak Barrel

- Slane

   > Nose sultanas, raisins, vanilla, Xmas cake
   >
   > Thick mouth feel, coated the mouth.
   >
   > A oak, spice, fruit.

- Glenrothes

   > Bigger nose, savoury umami egg seaside notes.
   >
   > Quite thick, coating.
   >
   > Flash of alcohol, lots of oak.
   >
   > With water less burn, more of the spices and sweetness to the
   > fore, long oak finish.

- Paul John

   > Massive blast on nose, nutty almond/walnut nose.
   >
   > Water makes nuttiness much more prominent. Brings out a syrup note.

- Kilkerran

   > Much tamer nose. Some seaside hints.
   >
   > Light Highland peat.

- Overeem

   > Port with a sour note

- Kilchoman

   > Quite pale
   >
   > Ashtray nose first, then rained out bonfire.
   >
   > Very light mouthfeel.
   >
   > Smoke, spice, oak drawing out.
   >
   > Later the nose calms down: less ash and a touch of iodine.

- Stroma

   > Nose is interesting. Honey, floral, maybe a chilli
   >
   > Thick in glass and syrupy in mouth, really coats tongue.

# 20th February

Sake appreciation at the Oak Barrel.

- *Shirakawa Onikoroshi* A little funky with floral notes. Clean taste
  with hints of fruit, sweet but quickly gone.

- *Shirakawa Komedakeno* A little restrained than the first. Feels and
  tastes a bit thinner.

- *Imada Fukucho Junmai Ginjo Genshu* Apple and melon. Fuller bodied
  taste, quite sweet. Feels a little fizzy in the mouth, as with some
  nigori.

- *Wakatsuru Oyamanishiki Junmai* A touch of funkiness, a little dry.

- *Wakatsuru Sohin Daiginjo* Quite restrained nose. Quite dry with a
  long finish. Feels rather viscous (for sake) in the mouth.

- *Wakatsuru Ginjo Koshu* Nose is quite prominent with funky, cheesey,
  savoury elements. Tangy acidic finish.

- *Heiwa Shuzo Tsuru-ume Yuzushu* Smells like yuzu. Tastes like yuzu.
  It's made from junmai sake and yuzu juice, so that's not really a
  surprise. Happily yuzu is delicious. Think limoncello without the
  sugary sweetness and you have a pretty good idea.

Wakatsuru also make whisky. I have a bottle of their Junenmyo blended
whisky.

# 27th February

After a company dinner several colleagues adjourned to the Baxter
Inn. This is one instance where I didn't note anything down.

# 1st March

[Kilkerran][4] [tasting with David Allen][5] at the Oak Barrel.

- Kilkerran 12 year old (46%) Lightly peated, sweet, spicy. A hint
  medicinal.

- Kilkerran 8 year old (56.2%) Nose has buggered off; just the tiniest
  hint of something sweet and medicinal. Less peat, gentler spice.

- *2016 Open Day Bottling* (56.4%) Single sherry cask. Very dark. Sweet
  nose, dried fruits - currants. Quite a fast finish. Honey, burned
  caramel.

- *Kilkerran Run Cask* Not much nose to speak of; smooth, raw sugar.

- *Kilkerran Madeira Cask* (57%) Sweet syrups. Thick. Cereal notes. More
  spices than the rum cask. Molasses.

- *Kilkerran Triple Distilled* Ex-bourbon. Low key, delicate nose.
  Cream. Stewed apple, cinnamon.

- *Kilkerran Triple Distilled Open Day 2017?* (60.3%) Vanilla, cream,
  caramel, butterscotch.

- *Kilkerran Heavily Peated* Peat but not super smokey. Sweet. Doesn't
  stick around.

# 9th March

This was the first attempt to resurrect the monthly whisky club I used
to run. A few people came - far fewer than needed to make it viable -
and we drank some Australian spirits:

- Limeburners PX Sherry Cask - [bottled for 'The Whisky Club'][6]
- Starward 10th Anniversary
- Upshot Australian Whiskey (It'd be bourbon if it was made in the US)
- Melbourne Moonshine Single Cask #5 - barrel aged moonshine

# 13th March

[North Star Spirits][18] [tasting with Iain Croucher][19] at the Oak
Barrel.

- *Benrinnes 10 Year Old PX Finish* Triple distilled. Sultana, caramel,
  cooked sugar. Plums and red fruit. Vanilla. Finishes with stewed fruit.

- *Cambus 24 Year Old Refill PX Butt* Single grain. Nose clean and clear,
  hints of resin. Run and rasin.

- *Bruichladdich 15 Year Old French Oak* Fruits. Long, dry, smokey
  finish. Pitchy.

- *Glenturret 8 Year Old Refill Ex-Bourbon* Savoury, meaty notes. Long,
  peaty finish. Very nice.

- *Orkney 17 Year Old PX Finish* Honey and herbs. Cream, sultanas, oils.

- *Islay 12 Year Old Refill Hogshead* Smokey, sweatness, heather. Lovely
  waves of alternating smoke and peat.

- *Montilla PX Fortified Wine* I'm no wine drinker (I'll generally drink
  water instead) but this is very nice.

I got a bottle of the Glenturret and, for the second time, missed out on
the fortified wine.

# 15th March

Whisky appreciation at the Oak Barrel.

- *Black Bottle* Treacle with a touch of dried summer fruits. A little smoke
  upfront, quickly fades. Short and simple.

- *North Star Vega* Blended malt. Sweet cherries and candied fruit. Thin.
  Touch of caramels. Finish has hints of banana.

- *Iniquity Batch 8* Medicinal notes, sweet, sourdough. Vanilla. Thick
  and syrupy.

- *Kilkerran 8 Year Old* A little smoke and peat. Quite sweet with
  developing spices.

- *Paul John Oak Barrel Bottling* Calm nose: almonds and walnuts.
  Unusually, to my taste, gets better with water.

- *Port Charlotte Islay* Smoke and peat. Lemongrass, fresh cut grass.
  Yum!

- *Limeburners Whisky Liqueur* Thick, golden. Honey and flowers (maybe
  eucalypts).
