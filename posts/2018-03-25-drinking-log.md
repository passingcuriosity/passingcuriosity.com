  I've been attending a lot of tastings, classes, etc. over the last
  year or so. Getting some details down in writing seems like a thing
  to do.

The last few years I've been dabbling with whisky and sake: attending
tastings and events, buying bottles of drinks I don't really know much
about, running a whisky club at work, etc. I often take notes about
what I drink but they generally aren't worth bothering with.

Below I've listed most of the events I've been to and what I drank,
along with a note or two.

# 4th February

I visited [Starward Distillery][1] in Port Melbourne and took the
distillery tour. It ended with a tasting and I tried one or two others
at the bar before heading for the airport and home to Sydney. I really
like Starward: they make some great whisky and they make sure it's
available and affordable.

- Starward Solera

- Starward Wine Cask

- One of their pre-mixed cocktails, can't remember which.

- Starward 10th Anniversary Bottling

Their 10th Anniversary Bottling is very nice and I bought some to take
home.

Whisky appreciation at the Oak Barrel

- Slane

   > Nose sultanas, raisins, vanilla, Xmas cake
   >
   > Thick mouth feel, coated the mouth.
   >
   > A oak, spice, fruit.

- Glenrothes

   > Bigger nose, savoury umami egg seaside notes.
   >
   > Quite thick, coating.
   >
   > Flash of alcohol, lots of oak.
   >
   > With water less burn, more of the spices and sweetness to the
   > fore, long oak finish.

- Paul John

   > Massive blast on nose, nutty almond/walnut nose.
   >
   > Water makes nuttiness much more prominent. Brings out a syrup note.

- Kilkerran

   > Much tamer nose. Some seaside hints.
   >
   > Light Highland peat.

- Overeem

   > Port with a sour note

- Kilchoman

   > Quite pale
   >
   > Ashtray nose first, then rained out bonfire.
   >
   > Very light mouthfeel.
   >
   > Smoke, spice, oak drawing out.
   >
   > Later the nose calms down: less ash and a touch of iodine.

- Stroma

   > Nose is interesting. Honey, floral, maybe a chilli
   >
   > Thick in glass and syrupy in mouth, really coats tongue.

# 9th March

This was the first attempt to resurrect the monthly whisky club I used
to run. A few people came - far fewer than needed to make it viable -
and we drank some Australian spirits:

- Limeburners PX Sherry Cask - [bottled for 'The Whisky Club'][6]
- Starward 10th Anniversary
- Upshot Australian Whiskey (It'd be bourbon if it was made in the US)
- Melbourne Moonshine Single Cask #5 - barrel aged moonshine
