An open letter to the Kansas School Board asking them to give "equal time" to Flying Spaghetti Monster-ism in their new science curriculum. They have numerous testimonials by persons qualified to make them (whereas Intelligent Design has none), lots of evidence (well, more then ID has anyway) and some truly inspirational art depicting Him and His Noodly Appendage.



RAmen.
