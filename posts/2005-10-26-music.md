I recently found a CD full of MP3's that a friend gave me whilst I was in England a few years ago. On it I found a bunch of songs by groups I hadn't thought about in a while. With the new songs stuck in my head, I ran out and bought [The Lost Prophets'](http://www.lostprophets.com) *The Fake Sound of Progress* and *Start Something*, both of which kick ass.

Next on the "to be acquired" list is Alien Ant Farm's *Anthology* album.

Update: Apparently not as Ill Ni√±o have a new album. I'll have to get *Anthology* later (when I can find it in a record shop, as there hasn't been a copy in any of the places I've looked).
