I recently found a CD full of MP3's that a friend gave me whilst I was in England a few years ago. On it I found a bunch of songs by groups I hadn't thought about in a while. With the new songs stuck in my head, I ran out and bought <a href="http://www.lostprophets.com/">the Lost Prophets'</a> <span class="title">The Fake Sound of Progress</span> and <span class="title">Start Something</span>, both of which kick ass.<br /><br />Next on the "<span style="font-weight:bold;">to be acquired</span>" list is <span class="title">Alien Ant Farm</span>'s <span class="title">Anthology</span> album.<hr/>Update: Apparently not as Ill Ni&#771;no have a new album. I'll have to get <span class="title">Anthology</span> later (when I can find it in a record shop, as there hasn't been a copy in any of the places I've looked).
