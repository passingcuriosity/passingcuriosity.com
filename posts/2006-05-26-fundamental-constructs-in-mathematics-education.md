[Fundamental Constructs in Mathematics Education][1] John Mason and Sue
Johnston-Wilder (editors).

After an introduction to the beingness of the thinghood of constructs (named,
described phenomena as far as I can tell), this book launches straight into
extracts describing some of the most important and influential experiments in
mathematics education. I've read the first chapter which describes a number of
experiments that have been used to investigate the way children learn
mathematical concepts. So far it has been a good deal more readable than I was
expecting.
