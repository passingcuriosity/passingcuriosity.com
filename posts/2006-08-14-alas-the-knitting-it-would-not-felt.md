I finished my knitting off last night and today I tried to felt it to no
avail. I shall have a go using the washing machine and tumble drier, but
the thought has occurred to me that perhaps the wool was treated to
prevent felting?

In any case, I'll give it a go and if it doesn't work, I'll just use my
knitting as knitting (instead of felt).
