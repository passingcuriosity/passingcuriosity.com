excerpt:
  I did the WSET Level 1 Award in Sake in March and the Level 3 in June.
  Here are some thoughts about both courses.

The [Wine and Spirit Education Trust][0] are a non-profit industry group
based in the UK who offer training and qualifications ([many regulated by
Ofqual][oq]) about wine, spirits, and hospitality. Being a drinker of *sake*
(the Japanese alcoholic drink brewed from rice) and a lover of training
and bits of paper, I was pretty interested to learn about their sake
courses and that they are offered in Sydney. I did the one-day
[WSET Level 1 Award in Sake][1a] in March and took a few days off in
June to do the [WSET Level 3 Award in Sake][1b], both taught by Leigh
Hudson at Chef's Armoury [Sakeshop][2] in Sydney.

The Level 1 course is a one day workshop (about 6 hours) suitable for
complete newcomers to *sake*. It covers some of the basics about sake in
quite broad strokes and introductions to some of the main categories and
styles of sake. I found the opportunity to compare different drinks the
most valuable part. Over the course of the day we tasted (more or less
in this order):

1. [Kirinzan Dento Karakuchi][3] (*futsushu*)
1. [Hanamikura Kuro][4] (*junmai daiginjo*)
1. [Nagaragawa Junmai][5] (*junmai*)
1. [Nagaragawa Tenkawa][6]
1. [Yamamoto Midnight Blue][7] (*junmai ginjo nama genshu*)
1. [Dewatsuru Sparkling Sakura Emaki][8]
1. [Daruma Masamune 3 Year Old Koshu][9]
1. [Kariho Junkei Karakuchi][10] (*junmai*)
1. [Kubota Shuzo Sou][11] (*namachozo*)

The first three were presented as examples of different grades of sake
(regular, super premium, and premium), and the nama (unpasteurised),
sparkling, and koshu (aged) are self evident. The day ended with a short
choice test and, a few weeks later, I got my grade, certificate, and
lapel pin.
