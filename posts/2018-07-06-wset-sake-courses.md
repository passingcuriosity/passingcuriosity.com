excerpt:
  I've taken the Wine and Spirits Education Trust Level 1 and Level 3
  awards in sake this year. Here are some thoughts.
---

The [Wine and Spirit Education Trust][0] are a non-profit industry group
based in the UK who offer training and qualifications ([many regulated by
Ofqual][oq]) about wine, spirits, and, in recent years, *sake* (the
Japanese alcoholic drink brewed from rice). Being a drinker of *sake* and a
lover of training and bits of paper, I was pretty interested to learn about
their sake courses and that they are offered in Sydney. I did the one-day
[WSET Level 1 Award in Sake][1a] in March and took a few days off in June
to do the [WSET Level 3 Award in Sake][1b], both taught by Leigh Hudson
at Chef's Armoury [Sakeshop][2] in Sydney.

The [WSET Level 1 Award in Sake][1a] course is more or less an introduction
to sake. It provides a basic understanding of sake production, grades and
styles of sake, and an introduction to service. The key, for me, was the
opportunity to taste a range of different sake in together. In something
resembling the order tasted:

1. [Kirinzan Dento Karakuchi][3] (futsushu)
1. [Hanamikura Kuro][4] (junmai daiginjo)
1. [Nagaragawa Junmai][5] (junmai)
1. [Nagaragawa Tenkawa][6]
1. [Yamamoto Midnight Blue][7] (junmai ginjo nama genshu)
1. [Dewatsuru Sparkling Sakura Emaki][8]
1. [Daruma Masamune 3 Year Old Koshu][9]
1. [Kariho Junkei Karakuchi][10] (junmai)
1. [Kubota Shuzo Sou][11] (namachozo)

The first three were selected as examples of different grades of sake,
and the nama (unpasteurised), sparkling and aged are self evident.

I'll have to dig out my notes about them all to fill in some details.
The day ended with a multiple choice exam and, a few weeks later, I got
my grade, certificate, and lapel pin.

The [WSET Level 3 Award in Sake][1b] course is longer and covers a lot more
detail. It also involves tasting a *lot* more sake over two and a half days.
In the approximate order of tasting:

The Level 3 exam has three papers: a multiple choice quiz, some short answer and essay
questions, and a blind tasting of two sake. Eleven weeks later I got my results (distinction
on the theory papers but only a pass on the tasting) with a certificate and a nift lapel pin.

Both courses were good fun and provided a great introduction and then a good foundational
knowledge of sake. There's still *lots* more for me to learn (and drink) but the WSET courses
give, I think, a pretty good start.
