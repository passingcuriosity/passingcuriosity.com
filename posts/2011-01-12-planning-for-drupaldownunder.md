  I'm off to Brisbane later this month for DrupalDownunder (and LCA). This is 
  a quick overview of the things I'm looking forward to.

While Brisbane and Queensland are in the grip of some fairly serious flooding
(please consider donating to the [Queensland state government relief
fund](http://www.qld.gov.au/floods/donate.html)) the official word is that
[DrupalDownunder will be going ahead][flood-update] so I've been going through
the programme and narrowing down the sessions I want to see. There are a few
bits and pieces I'm not sure of, but my weekend is going to look something
like this:

[flood-update]: http://drupaldownunder.org/flood-update

On Saturday there're two keynote sessions and five slots with competing
sessions.

1. The [Exportables](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/exportables) session
by [Simon Hobbs][simon-hobbs] will no doubt help in my quest to develop a
reliable and efficient workflow at work.

2. [Allie Micka][allie-micka]'s keynote [Running a Drupal business and
contributing to Drupal
sustainably](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/allie-mickas-keynote) is a
keynote and sounds interesting enough, if not quite my cup of tea.

3. [Dave Hall][dave-hall]'s [Building Distributions with Drupal
7](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/building-distributions-drupal-7) will,
again, help in my quest for standardisation and automation to simplify
workflows.

4. [Josh Waihi][josh-waihi]'s keynote [Goodbye Centralization, Hello
Distribution: An Introduction to
Git](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/keynote-goodbye-centralization-hello-distribution-introduction-git),
is an introduction to git (which I already use and am relatively familiar
with).

5. Given the number of times I've been asked about options for paid
membership, the [Paid Membership
Sites](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/paid-membership-sites) session by
[Chris Hood][chris-hood] will scratch an itch of mine (which other people have
been tickling).

6. As I've implemented two or three custom CCK fields (and others on my team
have implemented another few), [Ivan Zugec][ivan-zugec]'s session on [Fields
in Core: How to create a custom
field](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/fields-core-how-create-custom-field)
is sure to be interesting.

7. [Dries][dries]' keynote session with [details to
come](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/dries-keynote) is by Dries. And a
keynote. And by Dries.

My choices on Sunday are less clear cut in spite of having a choice in only
four slots:

1. I expect [John Zornig][john-zornig] session about [Building a document
management system in
Drupal](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/building-document-management-system-drupal)
to be inspiring when combined with my recent interest in Solr-based search.

2. Both [Turbo charge your Drupal
site](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/turbo-charge-your-drupal-site) by
[Kim Pepper][kim-pepper] and [Fancy Pants WYSIWYG
Editing](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/fancy-pants-wysiwyg-editing) by
[Boris Gordon][boris-gordon] sound interesting and useful.

3. [Session by Dries](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/session-dries).

4. I've got a bunch of projects coming up at work that need payment solutions
of various types so [The Payment api and its framework approach to module
development](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/session-allie-micka) by [Allie
Micka][allie-micka] will obviously be useful, but I'm personally interested in
systems administration and performance so [Horizontally Scaling
Drupal](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/horizontally-scaling-drupal) by
[Dave Hall][dave-hall] sounds interesting. [Simple page layouts and
customisations using Views, CCK and
CSS](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/simple-page-layouts-and-customisations-using-views-cck-and-css)
by [Dale Baldwin][dale-baldwin] sounds a bit entry level.

5. Both [Case-Study: ABC Dig
Music](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/case-studies-nswgov-and-abc) by
[David Peterson][david-peterson] and [Migrating to a Drupal Web
Environment](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/migrating-drupal-web-environment)
by [Fiona Bush][fiona-bush] sound like they'll have interesting insights. I'll
probably go Fiona's session, if only because I went to ANU for a while.

6. [Josh Koenig][josh-koenig]'s keynote session [details to
come](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/josh-koenigs-keynote).

7. [Lightning talks](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/lightning-talks) are
alway good (or, at least, over quickly).

Now that I've thought about it these plans will be making their way into my
calendar.
