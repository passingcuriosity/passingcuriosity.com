excerpt: 
  I went to a few concerts as part of the Sydney Festival this
  year. Here's a quick list and some links.

The [Sydney Festival][0] is a cultural extravaganza with something
like 120 events over around three weeks. I attended four concerts (in
chronological order):

- [Rautavaara][1];
- The [Alim Qasimov Ensemble][2];
- [Dalmatica: Chants of the Adriatic][3]; and
- [Lubomyr Melnyk][4].

The Sydney Symphony Orchestra played three of Einojuhani Rautavaara's
works. The first *Cantus arcticus â€“ Concerto for birds and orchestra*
uses recordings of bird song as an instrument to very great effect. I
bought box sets of Rautavaara's [12 Concertos][6]
and [Choral Works][7] later.

The Alim Qasimov Ensemble features Alim and his daughter Fargana as
vocalists and Rafael Asgarov, Rauf Islamov, Javidan Nabiyev, and Zaki
Valiyev playing a range of traditional instruments. The music is, the
programme told me, something of a fusion of the classical *mugham* and
more popular *ashiq* musical traditions of Azerbaijan. However it
comes about the concert was great (and
the [Spiritual Music of Azerbaijan][5] album is great too).

*Dalmatica: Chants of the Adriatic* is a collaboration between two
groups: Dialogos, a group of four female singers, and Kantaduri, a
group of six Croatian cantors. The programme explores Dalmatian
liturgical musical traditions from the middle ages which use both
Latin and church Slavonic. This was a really, really good concert and
I will be surprised if *Ispovidajte se Gospodinu, jer je dobar* (track
one on the [Dalmatica][8] CD or listen to the Youtube video embedded
above) is not amongst my 5 favourite tracks for 2017.

The last Sydney Festival concert I went to was Ukrainian-Canadian
*Lubomyr Melnyk* playing something of an introduction to his piano
music, particularly his technique of "continuous music". He spoke
quite a bit between pieces -- and said some things I found quite
strange -- but the music was amazing.

If the 3% of the programme I saw is any indication the 2017 Sydney
Festival was excellent and I'm already looking forward to 2018!
