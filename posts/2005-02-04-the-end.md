title: The End...
---

Today, the summer research scholarship program comes to an end (a lot of people
have already buggered off) and with it, my project. I've given my presentation,
have had my exit interview and am writing my report. It would be time to move
on if it weren't for that pesky lack of results.

Although this was a rather experimental "poke it an see what happens" project,
the "results" (or rather "result", or even more correctly "data") that I got is
not really satisfactory. To see if I can get any further, I'm going to
reimplement the technique using another library (the [InfoVis
Toolkit](http://ivtk.sf.net/)) whose data representation is more suited to
these purposes and will, hopefully make the technique fast enough to eliminate
the annoying lags the **prefuse** implementation suffered from.

Hopefully, I can get the reimplementation done, and finish the work on the log
processor quickly enough so that John has time to work the results into a paper
for CADE. I'd also like to try and get a paper (or a poster) ready for
submission to [GD 2005](http://www.gd2005.org/). I'm not expecting to get
anything into the conference, I don't even know if my technique is original,
but the paper writing practice can't hurt.
