[The Co-op Bookshop][1]

One of the things that surprised me upon arriving in Canberra (about eleven
weeks ago now) is the Co-op. Here, it's open 9AM 'til 5PM, seven days a week.
In Launceston, it doesn't even stay open until 5PM every weekday, or at all on
weekends. I think that they had a staffing problem this past year, but it is
still telling.  That the bookshop is open seven days, and carries more than
just the set and recommended texts for the various courses, is threw me out.

I have a feeling I'll get used to it though: books, every day of the week.
