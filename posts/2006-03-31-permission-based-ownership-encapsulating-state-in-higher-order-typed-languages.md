[Permission-based ownership: encapsulating state in higher-order typed
languages][1] by Neel Krishnaswami and Jonathan Aldrich. In PLDI'05.

I'm still puzzling through the examples, but it looks pretty cool. The
essential idea is to use the type system (an extension of <acronym>System
F</acronym> with references and ownership called <acronym>System
F<sub><i>own</i></sub></acronym>) to ensure that the internal details of
modules cannot be messed with.

They give an illustrative example involving customers in one domain, banking
machinery in a second and account details in a third. The customers are allowed
to call the banking machinery, and the banking machinery can access the account
details, and all other access is invalid. The goal of <acronym>System
F<sub><i>own</i></sub></acronym> is to prove these sorts of properties.
