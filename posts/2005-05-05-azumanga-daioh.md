I got the first volume of ADV Manga's translation of [Azumanga Daioh][1] today
and, having just read about half of it, I much prefer the scanlations to the
licensed product. Why can't the American companies that buy the rights to
translate anime and manga into English resist the urge to re-interpret the
characters and their lines?

We buy anime and manga precisely because we want to read Japanese comics and
watch Japanese animations. The horrible, grating, little changes that ADV Manga
made to make the book more palatable to an American audience (i.e. to dumb it
down) mean that I'll not likely buy another book from ADV Manga. I'd rather buy
books from Japan and download scanlations from the 'net than give my money to
butchers...
