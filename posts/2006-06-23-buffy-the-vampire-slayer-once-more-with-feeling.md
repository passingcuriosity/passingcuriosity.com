Still on a musical note (sorry), I just bought <a class="title" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=14768805">Once More, With Feeling</a> the cast album of the musical episode of <span class="title">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span>. It really demonstrates the versatility of the Buffy cast -- most of the tracks would, in my opinion, be releasable as commercial music. They sing really well for a bunch of actors and Josh Whedon did a really good job on the songs. If you're at all fond of <span class="title">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span> I recommend you get it.
