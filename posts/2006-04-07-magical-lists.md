title: Magical Lists
---
A not very recent <a href="http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2006-February/014282.html">post</a> (I'm trying to catch up; only 970 messages to go) to the Haskell-cafe mailing list pointed out that <a href="http://repetae.net/john/computer/jhc/">jhc</a> treats <code>(:)</code>, <code>[]</code> and <code>(,)</code> as normal data constructors. Some might see this as removing some of the magic from lists, but I see it as sharing the magic around. The number of times I've been annoyed that <code>(:)</code> is hard-coded for lists boggles the mind.
