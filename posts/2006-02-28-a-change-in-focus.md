Today I took the first step on a new path, that of teaching, with orientation day for the <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/courses/E3H">Bachelor of Teaching</a>. This semester I will be taking:

- <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/units/ESA160">Professional Studies</a>;
- <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/units/ESA166">Information Technology 1A</a>;
- <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/units/ESA184">Technology Education (Single)</a>; and
- <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/units/ESA196">Multi-literacies 1A</a>

The next few posts will concern my first impressions.
