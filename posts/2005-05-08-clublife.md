There are two things that make me love <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, the whole 'free blogging' thing and their <strong>Blogs of Note</strong> list.



Some of the funniest stuff I see on the 'net comes from that list. If humour is your thing, stop wasting time with the shitty "joke" sites, and get a Blogger account. Its well worth it.
