title: Licencing

A fourth post for today, also on a non-logic related topic. I'll be releasing an initial, non-modal, version of my code soon (in the next couple of weeks) and need to think about a licence for it. I've narrowed it down to four alternatives:<ul><li>the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.1/au/">attribution share alike</a> licence;</li> <li>the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.1/au/">attribution non-commercial share alike</a> licence; </li><li>the <a href="http://nicta.com.au/director/commercialisation/open_source_licence.cfm">Australian Public Licence B</a>; or</li><li>a BSD-like licence.</li></ul>I'm leaning toward the Creative Commons licences at this point, but the Australian Public License could be good as well.

If anyone has suggestions or arguments for or against any licence (please don't bother suggesting the GPL and friends), please leave a comment.
