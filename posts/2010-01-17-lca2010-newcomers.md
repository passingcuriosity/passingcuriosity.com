So LCA2010 is underway. It's been busy and it's only day two (day one really),
so I'll give a brief recap so that I can remember it later. Registration was
quick and painless and the swag is decent:

1. a nice-ish bag;
2. a few note books;
3. a USB flash drive with the programme and such;
4. the requisite t-shirt (and a hat)
5. some sunscreen (optimistic) and Lynx stuff (a very good idea!)

and some other stuff that I forget.

The newcomers session afterward with Rusty Russell and a woman whose name I
didn't catch me was informative and entertaining. They covered the programme
and talked about past LCAs, but the most useful is likely to be the "Advice,
Secrets and Lies" that many people wish they'd known before their first LCA.
