I ordered another book today: [Purely Functional Data Structures][1] by Chris
Okasaki.

I downloaded a PDF of his [PhD thesis (PDF, 616K)][2] and had a brief flick
through. It looks as though some of the structures will be just what I need.
One of the main differences (that I am aware of) between the thesis and the
book is that the book includes the source code in both ML and Haskell, whereas
the thesis only uses ML. The book will, therefore, be of a lot more use to me
than the thesis and at less than $AU70, it'll hardly break the bank.
