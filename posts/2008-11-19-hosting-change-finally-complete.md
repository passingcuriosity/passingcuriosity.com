title: Hosting change finally complete
---
The migration of this site to my new VPS is finally complete. After a bit of faffing around and waiting for request approvals to go through, the DNS migration happened yesterday but took more than 30 hours to become active due to the ridiculously long TTL on the NS records my old hosting company used.

This is now hosted with software I control, on a [virtual] server that I control and is not oversubscribed. Readers (both of you) can expect better performance and, in the next few days, a few new posts.
