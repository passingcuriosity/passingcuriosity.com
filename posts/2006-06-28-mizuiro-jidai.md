I've just finished watching the first episode of <a class="title" href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,271,htzesx,aqua_age.html">Mizuiro Jidai</a>. If the first episode and the <a href"http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,271,htzesx,aqua_age.html">AnimeNFO entry </a> are anything to go by, it seems like one of those slice of life/high-school school/drama/romance shows. It was OK (for something drawn in 1996), but I'm not sure I'm willing to download the next 46 episodes (forty-seven!).
