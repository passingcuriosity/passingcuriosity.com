I've just put in my preferences for my Professional Experience 3
placement next semester. In the interest of a well-rounded set of
practical experiences, I've requested a placement in either of the
senior secondary colleges in Launceston &mdash; <a
href="http://www.launc.tased.edu.au/">Launceston College</a> and <a
href="http://www.newstead.tased.edu.au/">Newstead College</a>. I did put
both down as my first and second preferences for prac. this semester,
but didn't reckon with exams, or whatever else made them decline prac.
students (or, maybe, just me). Once I have some senior secondary
experience, I'm planning on doing my internship at one of the private
schools, hopefully <a href="http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/">Scotch Oakburn
College</a> or the <a href="http://www.lcgs.tas.edu.au/">Launceston
Church Grammar School</a>.

If everything goes to plan, I'll have had six weeks in public secondary
schools (7-10), four weeks in a public senior secondary school (11-12),
and about seven weeks in a private secondary school. I'll have covered
the full secondary age range (12 y.o. to 17 y.o.) from a range of
socio-economic backgrounds in both the public and private systems.
