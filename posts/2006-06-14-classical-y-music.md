I've been looking around on <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> Music Store today and managed to spend more than $20, mainly on classical-y songs.

I started off looking for a good recording of <a class="title" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=83866283&s=143460">Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat</a>, my favourite Andrew Loyd Webber musical. A few track from the musical, and another also by <span class="author">Linzi Hateley</span> (who sings the part of the narrator in the <span class="author">London Palladium</span> cast), I moved on to that other staple of the musical genre (or, at least, my taste in musicals): Gilbert & Sullivan. After a few track from a number of renditions of <span class="title">The Pirates of Penzance</span> (<a class="author" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=61645243">The Mastersingers</a> track <a class="title" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=61647909&s=143460&i=61647293">The Pirates of Penzance</a> is particularly good, I'll have to look at more of their music), I moved on to classical music proper.

I only wound up buying a couple of tracks from the album <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=54419680&s=143460">Enchantment</a> by <a class="author" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=571040">Charlotte Church</a> (of whom I'll have to buy more) and <a class="title" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=55316539&s=143460&i=59326867">Ode II Joy (From Symphony No. 9)</a> by <a class="author" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=1321632">OperaBabes</a> (whom I'm also going to have to get more of).

For some reason, I've also been interested in Russian music lately &mdash; probably as an outgrowth of the interest in choral works &mdash; so I also bought <a class="title" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=78601787&s=143460&i=78601121">Kalinka</a> from the <a class="author" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=73040033">Alexandrov Red Army Choir</a>.

If anyone has any suggestions of good music in similar vein to the above mentioned track and artists, please leave a comment so that I can chase them up!
