Yesterday, I [began reading][1] [The Gene of Isis][2] by Traci Harding. I've
just finished part one and, I must say, I am slightly disappointed. I began the
book hoping that Harding would manage to avoid some of the more cloying "New
Age" themes in her earlier works, but soon enough the mischievous elemental
spirits emerged (if only in mention) accompanied with the various psychic and
auric phenomena of the Indic tradition (if I recall my New Age hype correctly)
so popular amongst the New Age community.

Part one is set in 19th century England. The main character Ashlee Granville is
a young woman with psychic abilities having to deal with "coming out" into high
society and the attendant problems, such as marrying, that confront her. While
the characters mannerisms and dialogue have a tinge of the formality
characteristic of the era, I still get the impression of a certain modernity,
especially with respect to Ashlee. Perhaps a more formal turn of phrase,
circumlocutious though it might be, would lend the story an air more
appropriate to a story set in such times.

Disappointing though these points are (especially Harding's approach to the
mystical, which is difficult to credit as anything other than a kowtow toward
the popular New Age movement), the tale is well-told; the premise, intriguing;
and the characters, especially Ashlee, engaging.

If you can bring yourself to brave the New Age elements of the story (or
perhaps have enjoyed Harding's other stories, especially *The Alchemist's Key*
and the *Ancient Future* trilogy) then I would heartily recommend reading The
Gene of Isis. If, on the other hand, the more popularist New Age approach to
the supernatural makes you cringe, perhaps you'd better pass this one over and
save yourself $AU29.95.
