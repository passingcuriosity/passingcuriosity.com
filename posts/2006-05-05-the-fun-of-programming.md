My copy of [The Fun of Programming][1] edited by Jeremy Gibbons and Oege de
Moor came in the other day and I've been looking through it. It has chapters
covering a wide range of topics:

1. functional data-structures, amortised analysis, etc.;

2. testing and specification with QuickCheck;

3. programming with folds, unfolds, etc.;

4. music programming;

5. representing financial contracts;

6. graphics programming;

7. hardware description;

8. combinators;

9. arrows; and

10. phantom types

amongst other topics. This looks to be a fascinating mixture of methods
(data-structures, testing, folds, arrows, etc.) and applications (music,
graphics, financial contacts, hardware description, logic programming, etc.) if
a little thin for its price.

Both the [software from the book][2] and [details about the symposium][3] from
which its content comes are available on the Oxford Computing Laboratory
web-site.
