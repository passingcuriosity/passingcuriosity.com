I've started on a layout algorithm based on the concept of adjacency matrices.
At the moment, it's a full matrix, but as soon as I can think of an elegant
way to code it, I'll be tearing out as much of the white space as I can. In
essence, the new layout will be a visual parallel of the adjacency lists data
structure for storing sparse graphs.

We'll see how I go, but I think that this approach might be more general than
a radial layout algorithm. Having animations of a few minimal spanning tree or
network flow algorithms would be quite cool.
