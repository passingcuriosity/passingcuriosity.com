title: The Cloudbuilders
---
We've just read a sci-fi story called <span class="title">The Cloudbuilders</span> in my ICT curriculum class which, as far as I can tell was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kapp">Colin Kapp</a> in 1968. While a little formulaic (though, being nearly 40 years old, it probably helped to define the formula) it was an interesting read and <emph>did</emph> result in an interesting discussion of technology education touching on educational approaches, little white lies, paternalism, etc.

You might be able to find more information through <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+Cloudbuilders%22">Google</a> but there doesn't seem to be a great deal on the first page.
