---

The [Oak Barrel][1] have been running an annual whisky fair since 2010. This year I went to the fair itself
and a few of the other events in the lead up.

## Creative Whisky Company tasting

[The first event][a] was a tasting of whiskies from [Creative Whisky Company][2] to celebrate their launch in
the Australian market.

- "Speyside" 9yo at 50% (from GlenAllachie). Gave me hints of lemon, wood, vanilla, barley sugar. A touch
of sweetness, vanilla, honey, spices. Medium finish with a touch bright red fruits.

- Dailuaine 10yo sherry cask at 55.6%. Touch medicinal at first. Honey, sweet herbs, resin, savoury. A bit
thick, syrupy, warm, oily. Quite rich, meaty. Oak, stewed fruits, spices.

- Glen Keith 23yo ex-bourbon cask at 52.8%. Sweet, hint of crisp tart apples, honey, vanilla, and musk. Vanilla,
golden syrup, honey, ripe pomaceous fruit. Woody finish.

- Ardmore 18yo ex-rum cask at 56.4%. Light peat and heather. Oak, peat, smoke, heather, honey, spices, a
touch of minerality.

- "Orkney" 15yo refill sherry hogsheads at 56.7% (from Highland Park). Medicinal, sea-side, mineral. A little
whisp of peat, fades to sweetness, honey, lingering oak spice finish.

- Laphroig 12yo refill bourbon hogshead at 56.2%. A rather restrained Islay peat smoke. Medicinal peat, heather.
Quite short finish. A nice Laphroig.

- "Peated Highland" at 50% (from GlenTurret). Restrained peat, whisp of campfire smoke, sweetness, touch of
honey. Oak finish.

I liked the Ardmore and the Orkney.

## Rest & Be Thankful tasting

[The second event][b] presented a number of bottlings from the 2017 and 2018 releases from another independent
bottler [Rest & Be Thankful][3].

- Tomore 1995 22yo at 44.7% (2018 release).
- Tomintoul 1995 22yo at 51.5% (2018 release).
- Arran 1996 18yo at 55.3% (2017 release).
- Allt-a-Bhainne 1995 21yo 54.5% (2018 release).
- Ledaig 1997 19yo at 51% (2018 release).
- Octomore 2009 6yo Pauillac at 66.9% (2017 release).
- Port Charlotte 2002 13 yo as 63.5% (2017 release).

## GlenDronach single cask tasting

[The third event][c] was a tasting of single cask whiskies from [GlenDronach][4]. GlenDronach makes heavy, oily
spirit and puts it in big sherry casks (which tend to be Oloroso unless specified otherwise).

- 2005 12yo ex-PX puncheon #1451 at 56.1%
- 2002 15yo PX puncheon #4648 at 54.7%
- 1995 22yo PX #3311 at 50.3%
- 1993 24yo Oloroso #55 at 56.7%
- 1992 25yo Oloroso butt #127 at 50.9%
- 1990 27yo PX #7902 at 52.1%

## Tasmanian whisky tasting with Tim Duckett

[The fourth event][d] was a tasting of Australian whiskies (and spirits) by Tim Duckett.

The first few things on taste aren't whisky -- the gin is a gin and the next three are too young -- but the rest
are from salwarts of the Tasmanian whisky scene.

- Gin from Lawrenny
- New make spirit from Lawrenny
- Peated new make from Adams
- Adams Slosh Cask Update
- Nant White Oak
- Tasmanian Independant Bottlers Old Kempton
- Belgrove Rye
- Heartwood Night Thief
- Heartwood Shade of Night
- Heartwood Convict Resurrection

## Whisky Fair

Finally, there was the fair itself. At an event like this there are so many drams on offer that you really can't taste them all in the time available. I consulted the list of confirmed exhibitors and wrote a list of things that I knew I wanted to try and/or buy to try to work through systematically. I did miss a few things that, after the fact, I'd quite like to have gotten to but had a really good time tasting some fantastic whisky.

All up, I tried around 43 drams from Scotland, Ireland, the USA, Japan, France, and Australia. Amongst my
favourites were (in a vague sort of order dictated more by what I already have in my collection than by the
qualities of these whiskies):

- Hyde Cask Strength 8yo Single Grain
- North Star Campbeltown 4yo Blended Malt
- North Star Montilla PX Fortified Wine
- Belgrove Peated Rye
- Starward's Bourbon Cask
- Kilchoman Port Cask 2018
- Koval Millet
- Whisky Exchange "Port Askaig"

In the end I went home with the first five of these.

Things I'd like to have tasted include the Redbreast range (especially the Oloroso), the Glenfarclas range,
and some of the offerings from other independent bottlers: Berry Brothers & Rudd, Douglas Laing, SMWS.
