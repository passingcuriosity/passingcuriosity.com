I've just been to the comic shop spending the money I should be saving for
kitchenware and next weeks food (I'll have to cook my own meals after I move
into B&G tomorrow). I got [Dead@17: The Complete First Series][1] (available on
[kindle][2]), [Aria Volume One][3] and [Remote Volume One][4].

I got *Aria* as the cover art reminded me a little of *Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou*
as did the cover text. I've not read it yet, but a quick flick through has made
me want to go back (though the shop will be closed now) and buy the other two
volumes although, now that I think about it, they only had the third on the
shelf. If this book turns out to be anywhere near as good as *YKK*, I'll have
to try an get some more of his work.

I haven't read *Remote* yet, but I chose it due primarily to the cover text
and the colour section at the front (though a quick flick through the book
cemented the decision). I usually like detective and police related anime and
manga (series such as *Spiral*, *Saint Tail* and the various *Patlabor* films,
books and series come to mind) so I don't think this is much of a gamble.

I have just finished reading *Dead@17* and it has once again reminded me that
the Japanese do not have a monopoly on great comics. I'm definitely going to
be getting the rest of *Dead@17* and sooner rather than later.

It looks like Impact are going to be getting hold of a large chunk of my
disposable income in the immediate future.
