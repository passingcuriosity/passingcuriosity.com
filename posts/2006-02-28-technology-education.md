(Single)</a>

In the next few days (i.e: before Thursday), I need to decide on a technology
module to do this semester. The co-ordinator told us this morning that there
are six choices:

- principals of design;
- design in wood; and
- food technology

run concurrently in the morning, and

- textiles;
- hard materials design; and
- computer aided design;

run concurrently in the afternoon class.

I'll probably do <acronym title="Computer Aided Design">C.A.D.</acronym> (what
with my other specialisation being <acronym title="Information and
Communication Technology">ICT</acronym> and all).
