<span class="title">An efficient implementation of SELF a dynamically-typed object-oriented language based on prototypes</span> by Craig Chambers, David Ungar, and Elgin Lee. <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/papers/oopsla89.ps.gz">(PS)</a>

I read this paper for a compulsory milestone papers course at the <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/">ANU Department of Computer Science</a>. In it, the authors describe the techniques used to implement that the SELF efficiently. SELF was unusual (and still is, in some respects) in that it was a dynamic, prototype-based object-oriented language. The techniques pioneered by the SELF team formed the foundation upon which most modern virtual machines, including the various JIT technologies for Java, are built. 

This paper and SELF have been discussed at Lambda the Ultimate on <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/767#comment-6989">a</a> <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/classic/message12290.html">number</a> of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&domains=http%3A%2F%2Flambda-the-ultimate.org&q=self+dynamic+prototype+language&btnG=Search&sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Flambda-the-ultimate.org">occasions</a>.
