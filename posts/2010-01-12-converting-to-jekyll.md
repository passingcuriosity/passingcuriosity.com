  This blog has been languishing for months now, nearly
  untouched. I'm changing that now, by throwing WordPress away and
  replacing it with Jekyll.

I've been running neglected blogs for a while now. Initially, I was
using [Blogger][1] to post news for a club at university. Later I
blogged notes about a research project, my honours topic, and assorted
other stuff I was doing. When I started studying education, I started
another blog about it. Eventually, I bought a domain, signed up for
hosting, installed [Wordpress][2] and imported all those old posts.

I've posted off and on since then but it's been sporadic and rather
lacklustre.

At least part of this was due to the tedium of using my
cobbled-together blogging platform of Wordpress with a bunch of
plugins. Combining the built-in Wordpress formatting with Markdown, a
number of syntax highlighting solutions and two or three other filters
didn't make for the easiest or more reliable system.

Now, though, I'm taking the next step and jumping on the semi-custom
blog software bandwagon (and the static site bandwagon, and the Ruby
bandwagon while I'm at it). I've replaced my old Wordpress blog with a
static site generated with [Jekyll][jk] from Markdown source.

I wasted ages -- months and months -- pretending to write my own
system in Haskell, but I was just lying to myself. I gave in and chose
Jekyll as system I'd heard good things about (in a language I'd heard
good things about). Then I wasted more months pretending to design my
own layout, but I was *still* lying to myself. Tonight I admitted that
I was never going to finish and decided to use [Mark Reid][mr]'s
excellent and [open source][mrl] design, at least to start with.

A few hours later, and it's done. I've pared Mark's templates down a
little so that they fit my content, run it through Jekyll, and now
it's live.

In the not too distant future (read: never) I intend to modify the
design and make it my own. In the mean time, enjoy the content.
