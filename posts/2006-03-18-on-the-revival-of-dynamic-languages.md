title="On the Revival of Dynamic Languages"> On the Revival of Dynamic
Languages</a> by Nierstrasz O, Bergel A, Denker M, Ducasse S, Gälli M, Wuyts
R.

This paper reads a little like propaganda for dynamic languages. The
discussion on Lambda the Ultimate (linked below) raises some interesting
points and points out some of the inconsistencies in their argument (static
languages can't prove <emph>everything</emph>, so let's use dynamic languages
which prove <emph>nothing</emph>).

That aside, the authors do discuss some interesting language features.
First-class namespaces can be used, as they describe, to implement horizontal
sub-classing (a compelling use case has been discussed on <a
href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1277">LtU</a>). Similarly, their
desire for pluggable type systems seems a little reminiscent of the approach
that the <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> project has taken with object
spaces. On the other hand, I don't really like their suggestion that
image-based languages are the way to go (I much prefer to write code in my
favourite editor, manage it using my favourite version control system, etc.).
All up, it's an interesting read (if only for the descriptions of the various
language features the authors like).
