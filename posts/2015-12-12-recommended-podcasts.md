I spend quite a lot of time listening to podcasts on a range of
topics. If you can recommend any particularly good podcasts please
[get in contact](/contact/) but, in the mean time, here's a list of
the feeds I'm currently subscribed to and a few words about each.

# Comedy

[Friday Night Comedy from BBC Radio 4][1] rotates between the News
Quiz and the Now Show. The former is a panel quiz and the largely
satire and sketches, both focusing on current events.

[No Such Thing As A Fish][2] is a weekly podcast hosted by the QI
Elves. Each week they present and discuss their favourite facts. If
you've ever watched an episode of QI on television you pretty much
know what to expect.

# Music

[The Concert][3] from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum consists of
recording of music performances at the museum. If you like classical
music, subscribe!

# Science & Humanities

[Thinking Allowed][9] is a weekly BBC Radio 4 programme about the
social sciences. Each episode features one or two short interviews
with researchers or authors in the social sciences with a bit of
background, correspondence, etc. from the host.

[In Our Time][12] is a weekly BBC Radio 4 programme in which the host
is joined by three experts to discuss a topic from history, science,
philosophy, and more besides. Melvyn Bragg is a good host and the
guests are always excellent.

The [History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps][7] and its newer sibling
[History of Philosophy in India][8] aim to introduce listeners to the
grand sweep of "Western" and Indian philosophy respectively. They are
both eminently accessible and highly entertaining.

[Up Close][10] is a "research talk show" produced by the University of
Melbourne. They interview researchers, graduate students, and visitors
to the University about their research, covering pretty much every
academic discipline you can think of.

[Elucidations][5] is a philosophy podcast from the University of
Chicago. Each episode is an interview with a prominent philosopher
about their research. The hosts (graduate students at the university)
are great and they get some truly outstanding guests.

While the Aristotelian Society was formed in 1880 their
[Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society][11] podcast only stretches
back to 2011. Each episode is a recording of a philosopher delivering
a paper to the society.

# Computer-y things

[Risky Business][6] is a weekly podcast about computer security. The
news segment can be pretty funny and feature interviews are usually
informative. Each episode also includes a sponsor interview and even
they are usually pretty good.

I've recently subscribed to a few podcasts covering topics like data
mining, machine learning, and data science. [Talking Machines][14],
[Data Skeptic][15], and [Linear Digressions][16] are all pretty good
with a range of content about these fields.

It's been a while since either of the [Haskell Cast][13] or the
[Type Theory Podcast][4] published an episode but I continue to
hope. The former interviews people who have an impact in the Haskell
programming language community and the latter interviews guests on
topics related to [type theory][17].
