[RFC4042: UTF-9 and UTF-18 Efficient Transformation Formats of Unicode][1]

I can't tell if this is an April Fools RFC (the probable status) or a genuine
proposal that has been misunderstood. It is certainly a far cry from the HTCPCP
(Hyper-Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol) RFCs of yore. If nothing else,
a nine-bit encoding is an interesting exercise.
