A work project took me to the UK for the greater part of 2022. While I needed to
be in the UK, I didn't have to be anywhere in particular for most of that time
so I spent some time visiting places I hadn't been to before. Mostly places with
distilleries, breweries, and the like.

Over the course of nine months or so, I visited:

1. Kanpai Sake Brewery, London
