I'm going away for a few days tomorrow (or, having looked at the clock, today) and do not plan on checking my e-mail, my news feeds, or in anyway interacting online. Hopefully, this'll give me a chance to catch up on some reading and get to some of the half-dozen papers I've been wanting to read and post here.

More in a four or five of days.
