Recent [Data Mining][1] lectures have been looking at the [Apriori
Principle][2] The discussion of a set-theoretic framework within which to
consider data mining (more specifically, market basket analysis) prompted me to
have a look in the maths section of the bookshop for a book on the topic.  I
came out with a copy of [Introduction to Lattices and Order][3]. What [little]
I've read of it so far is very well written.

The bad news is that I need to get back into reading so that I can write the
literature review and background sections of my thesis without screwing
anything up or misrepresenting anything too badly. I have a feeling that it's
going to be a long time before I finish up the *17* books I've got bookmarks
in.
