  Notes from an announcement at Barcamp Perth 2009 about the "World Blog
  Awards".
---

Talk about the "World Blog Awards", a blog awards event to be held in Perth,
Western Australia. Nomination and self-nomination is not guaranteed to result
in an award but it is, apparently, likely.

Also, we need to get the whole WA blog community thing back. There were a few
lists and blogrolls of WA and Perth, but most of them are no longer updated.
Lots of discussion about establishing such a community: should it be
location-focussed, or not. Highlighting West-Australian-ness, might be a point
of differentiation, but also might be premature optimisation. Also,
maintaining such a list is a <strong>lot</strong> of work, so automation is
the name of the game. Microformats are the right solution: either a specific
tag, hgeo, or something that can be added easily, and automatically found to
find "our" blogs.

The speaker wants to see:
<ul>
<li>Better support &amp; cooperation</li>
<li>Local based ID system</li>
<li>Connect to each other</li>
<li>other stuff</li>
</ul>
