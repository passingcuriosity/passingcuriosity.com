There are a few topics that I'm interested in reading about, but haven't got
any books on yet. This post will serve as a repository of these topics (so that
I don't forget about any of them).

- [Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories][1] is on
  category theory ([Jon Cohen][2] recommended it to me)

- [Sets for Mathematics][3] does sets (of which I have only an  informal
  understanding)
