I've decided to make the lesson plans, materials and such I write freely available under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.1/au/">Attribution, NonCommerical, ShareAlike license</a> from <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.

The first lot of material I'm making available are the lesson plans for teaching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagoras' Theorem</a> that I developed last semester (and <a href="http://interestingexperience.blogspot.com/2006/05/teaching-first-reaction.html" title="Teaching; A First Reaction">wrote</a> <a href="http://interestingexperience.blogspot.com/2006/05/teaching-second-reaction.html" title="Teaching; A Second Reaction">about</a> <a href="http://interestingexperience.blogspot.com/2006/05/other-shoe-drops.html" title="The Other Shoe Drops">using</a>).
