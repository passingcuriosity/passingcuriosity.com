Passing Curiosity is the personal blog of [Thomas Sutton][me]. It's mostly
a dumping ground for notes about things I've read, written, or attended. I'm
a software developer in Sydney, Australia so much of the content is about
programming and located in Australia.

The site itself is built using [Hakyll][], a static site generator written in
[Haskell][]. The theme uses [Bootstrap][] and is based on the [Clean Blog][]
design. All content -- including the photography -- is by me.
